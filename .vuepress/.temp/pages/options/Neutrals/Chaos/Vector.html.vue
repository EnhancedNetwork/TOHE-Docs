<ul>
<li>And the canons went BOOM!
Disclaimer : Title has been used twice..
The vector knew one thing
He knew how to jump
And Jump...
And... Jump</li>
</ul>
<p>Well He could also eat and walk and talk
But jumping was his passion...</p>
<p>And he understood one thing..
It took energy so it took time for him to jump between every jump..
Now the vents made so much sound it made others go insane....</p>
<p>And then the engineer turned the heat up
The Scavenger became more hyper and ate 5 Beans...</p>
<p>Too much for everyone and when it passes a certain limit</p>
<p>Everyone went Insane with the sound
Clank Clank
&quot;Shut it man&quot;
&quot;Stop&quot;
&quot;Is he Jester?&quot;
&quot;Why&quot;</p>
<p>And then he did it
He made everyone end themselves
And the captain crashed the ship... All because of him....</p>
<p>Making people mad... sounds good..
In this case was good too</p>
<p>The End</p>
