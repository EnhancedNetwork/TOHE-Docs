<p>Chapter 1: Darkness</p>
<p>The crewmates were in a state of panic. The lights had gone out, and a shadowy figure darted through the darkness, leaving chaos in its wake. Blood spattered the walls, and the sense of impending doom hung heavily in the air.</p>
<p>Chapter 2: Flashback</p>
<p>“Ah, what a great day!” thought the scientist, immersed in his research on nanoparticles. He envisioned a groundbreaking technology that would enhance agility and stealth. This invention was meant as a gift for the sheriff. With a stroke of genius, he created the Ninja Suit. This suit could mark a target and then render the wearer invisible for a brief moment. In an instant, the wearer could shift from one location to another—one moment in Electrical, the next in Admin.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Back to Reality</p>
<p>Back in the present, the crewmates were on edge, struggling to navigate the pitch-black environment. One crewmate, frustrated by a mischievous fellow flicking the wrong switches, suddenly heard a chilling SLASH. Panic set in as two crewmates whispered urgently to each other.</p>
<p>“Where is he? Where is he?”
“Keep your head down; he’s aiming for the lights!”
“He’s using the darkness to conceal his approach!”</p>
<p>Another SLASH echoed through the air—three kills in mere seconds. The remaining crewmates realized they were in grave danger.</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Sabotage Resolved</p>
<p>“Finally!” exclaimed one crewmate as he fixed the sabotage, just in time to spot the shadowy figure nearby. With only three crewmates left, they were at a disadvantage. The agile Ninja was a master of evasion. Believing he was safe, they ejected an innocent crewmate, thinking they had eliminated the threat.</p>
<p>But the Ninja had been in control the entire time. Once a brilliant scientist, he had succumbed to the temptation of his own creation. “Why should I share this gift?” he thought. “It’s mine—only mine!”</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In the end, technology can be both a healer and a harbinger of chaos. The Ninja, once a scientist driven by innovation, now embraced his darker side, proving that brilliance can lead to ruin.</p>
<p>The End</p>
