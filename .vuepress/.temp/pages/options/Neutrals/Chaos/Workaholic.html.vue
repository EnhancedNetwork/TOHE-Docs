<summary><b><font color=gray>Unofficial Lore</font></b></summary>
<p>&quot;The More I work The More Luck I Gain&quot;
The workaholic was known to be a big... BIG gambler but he believed as a superstition that he would become Extra lucky and win more if he worked more</p>
<p>Brilliant I guess...
The crew feared him... If he had no more work he would just make a bet with Mr. Sloth and win... And this win will make them</p>
<p>Loose.</p>
<p>So they assigned him more and MORE tasks..
But he kept speeding to them and doing them</p>
<p>&quot;Tie him up&quot;
&quot;But sir... isn't that unfair&quot;
&quot;DO IT&quot;</p>
<p>And they tied him up... Resisting he broke away but the Impostor stabbed him...</p>
<p>&quot;What did you do&quot; YELLED the captain</p>
<p>&quot;Where.. am I&quot;
You're in heaven buddy.. Told the medium..
&quot;Just kidding you're a ghost!&quot;</p>
<p>Complete your tasks to win!
As the Workaholic remembered his goal he rushed...
And flipped the right energy in shields...
Turning them on..</p>
<p>He... did it..
No more tasks..
Marching to the office of Mr. Sloth he bet him that he would win Russian roulette..
Being fearful Mr. Sloth denied.</p>
<p>And the workaholic was given command of the Skeld...
He crashed it.</p>
<p>The End</p>
