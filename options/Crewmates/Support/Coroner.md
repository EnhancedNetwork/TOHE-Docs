As a Coroner you can’t report bodies, instead when you try to report, you will see an arrow pointing towards the killer. If a meeting is called, the arrows disappear.
* Max
  * Set how many Coroners can be in a match
* Arrows pointing to dead bodies
  * <font color=green>ON</font>: the Coroner will receive an arrow (like [Mortician](./Mortician)) pointing towards any dead bodies
  * <font color=red>OFF</font>: the Coroner will not receive any arrows
* Bodies the Coroner uses can’t be reported
  * <font color=green>ON</font>: any body that the Coroner interacts with cannot be reported
  * <font color=red>OFF</font>: the body that a Coroner interacts with can still be reported
* Initial Ability Use Limit
  * Set the amount of Ability Uses a Coroner has at the start of the game
* <font color=#00ffff>Amount of Ability</font> <font color=#7fffd2>Use Gains</font> <font color=#00ffff>with Each Task Completed</font>
  * Set the amount of Ability Uses a Coroner gains with each Task completed (0.1 increments)
