They worked together for The Mastermind, playing tricks and executing plans, always ready to support one another. Their friendship was strong, but everything changed one fateful day.</p><p>Chapter 1: The Prank Backfires One morning, as they drove to work, The Inhibitor decided to play a prank on The Saboteur by tampering with his car. However, the prank went awry, and they accidentally struck a mysterious figure in the road. Panic set in as they jumped out to assess the situation.</p><p>The Inhibitor: ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm so sorry! The car was sabotaged!‚Äù Mysterious Figure: ‚ÄúBoth of you! You‚Äôve caused enough trouble in this town. What should your punishment be?‚Äù</p><p>Terrified, they sped away, realizing the gravity of their mistake.</p><p>Chapter 2: A Strange Curse After the incident, The Saboteur found himself unable to complete any kills. Frustration mounted as he failed repeatedly, and he wondered if the mysterious figure&#39;s words had cursed him.</p><p>The Saboteur: ‚ÄúThis is the fifth time! Do you think what that strange guy said was true?‚Äù The Inhibitor: ‚ÄúMaybe... it started after the accident.‚Äù</p><p>Desperate to regain his skills, The Saboteur vowed to find the source of his misfortune.</p><p>Chapter 3: Confrontation and Guilt When he stumbled upon a newspaper article hinting at the incident, he confronted The Inhibitor.</p><p>The Saboteur: ‚ÄúDid you really sabotage my car?!‚Äù The Inhibitor: ‚ÄúIt was just supposed to be a little revenge!‚Äù The Saboteur: ‚ÄúA LITTLE?! I can‚Äôt kill anymore because of you!‚Äù</p><p>The tension escalated into an argument, and in the heat of the moment, they parted ways, leaving their friendship in tatters.</p><p>Chapter 4: A Heavy Heart The Inhibitor felt a deep sense of guilt for what had happened. Every time a sabotage occurred during missions, she was reminded of their broken bond. The weight of their conflict made it nearly impossible for her to act as an impostor.</p><p>Now, when sabotages occurred, The Inhibitor would hesitate, unable to strike while memories of their friendship haunted her. The Saboteur&#39;s curse lingered, a reminder that sometimes, the bonds we forge can become our greatest challenges.</p><p>Epilogue: As time passed, both impostors learned that their actions had consequences, shaping not only their fates but also their friendship. Now, when sabotage was needed, it was a race against time‚Äîbecause stalling could stall The Inhibitor.</p><blockquote><p>Submitted by: burgerman7286</p></blockquote>",14))])])}const y=h(u,[["render",g]]),w=JSON.parse('{"path":"/options/Impostors/Killing/Inhibitor.html","title":"Inhibitor","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"lang":"en-US","title":"Inhibitor","prev":"Hangman","next":"Instigator"},"headers":[],"git":{"updatedTime":1728767165000,"contributors":[{"name":"Moe","username":"Moe","email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","commits":5,"url":"https://github.com/Moe"},{"name":"Pyro","username":"Pyro","email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","commits":10,"url":"https://github.com/Pyro"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"8136e77622d793028f3522612f3c2c435e5add71","time":1728767165000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"2nd lore batch (imp killing)"},{"hash":"7fc68e1230c9315e7f360c63aba8ea6b51537745","time":1727502289000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"Prepare Impostors for LORE EVENT"},{"hash":"92d6deef7a71f2fdee42e9709258c51c4a4d1496","time":1723308435000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"small edits"},{"hash":"570f207184c09c7e057dd483a58c21261054692d","time":1722089336000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"a well needed name update"},{"hash":"b68b0b8db2d9a0add00403a3d13ff00947637072","time":1712986216000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"Fixing Commit"},{"hash":"306a0e8118d1ff168a0a7783f087ab8e3d6123f8","time":1711465575000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"Impostors"},{"hash":"2426ac62a661645258e6ef08e13476b55e1fd892","time":1701264583000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"code spacing"},{"hash":"db73fb8c31df6610930eafbc5ca6fc961d73db1b","time":1699302196000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"Updated to v1.2.1 Dev4"},{"hash":"26b30d44c5cb808a938cba010a335e9807e1344d","time":1697273020000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"sidebars and coloring/bolding of roles"},{"hash":"dd8990e91e0ba57c4f28b3dd84a7173356b9af93","time":1697089321000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"a lot"},{"hash":"4cc5756ae7ef36b34f062c53fa8393fddefc459e","time":1692162152000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"ImpostorSidebars"},{"hash":"edb5122a2c999484463439f630c3f9c83f307f65","time":1692073277000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"3.0.0 Dev 1 Build Changes"},{"hash":"a446d5319c8f2562731d64fa849640b3407cb3b6","time":1691990853000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"Adding Sidebars to Killing Impostors"},{"hash":"9248f765685c2882c6e452b3f1f06543b7a2aec1","time":1691287625000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"dev8.1"},{"hash":"0eb4fd4e982e4a0f59181d864e68cb1e31069d01","time":1691109314000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"update"}]},"filePathRelative":"options/Impostors/Killing/Inhibitor.md"}');export{y as comp,w as data};
