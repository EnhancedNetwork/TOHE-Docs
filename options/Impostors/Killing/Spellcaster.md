The Spellcaster has two attack methods: Direct Killing & Spelling. Pressing the Kill button twice (Depending on Switch Method) will result in a normal kill. Pressing the Kill button once will cast a spell on the Spellcaster’s target. During the Meeting, the Spellcasters target(s) will have a symbol next to their name (A cross) indicating that they were Spelled. If the Spellcaster is not ejected/guessed by the end of the meeting, all of their targets will die when the Meeting concludes.
