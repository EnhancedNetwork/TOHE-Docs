<p>The collector got in a deal with The mastermind
If the collector could supply a specific number of voted to the mastermind then he could persuade the game master to let them win
But then due to &quot;Natural Causes&quot;
The Mastermind died as soon as he told the collector this strategy</p>
<p>Now the collector was known to be quite a nerd.
He would go on developing amazing ways of stealing items and collecting them basically</p>
<p>He invented a machined to record finger prints and the more times he would record them the more he could collect</p>
<p>And this worked fine
But then he had an idea what if he replicated his own finger prints?</p>
<p>Well turns out</p>
<p>He burnt his fingers once and lost fingerprints</p>
<p>Well he can still win if 15 or more people recored finger prints but how?</p>
<p>Well duplication is fine but this tool is so expensive so what if he just...
Put this in the system recording votes of anyone person...</p>
<p>Then he got his voted
14/15...</p>
<p>What now? It's only 4 people left and 1 killer..
What if he said one of the killers was his medic and Hard cleared him... and self reported?</p>
<p>Amazing idea...
And due to this He died...</p>
<p>But the game master was able to make this loss turn to a win!</p>
<p>Wow... mastermind really lost a good way of winning due to &quot;Natural Causes&quot;</p>
