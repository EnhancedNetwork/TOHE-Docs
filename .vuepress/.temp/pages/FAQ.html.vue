<details>
<summary><b><font color=gray>What are Host-Only mods?</font></b></summary>
<p>Host-Only mods are mods that are compatible with vanilla clients, meaning it only needs to be installed by the host and other players can still play without installing the mod.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b><font color=gray>The role reveal at the start of the game shows that I am one role/team, <font color=#996d6d>but in game I am a different role/team</font>, why?</font></b></summary>
<p>In order to be compatible with vanilla, Host-only mods have to give you a Impostor base so that you can have the kill button. (Or for some roles, such as Crewpostor, you are an Impostor but your base is Engineer so that you can do Tasks to kill.) So for players who don't have the mod installed, you will see that you are an Impostor with no teammates. The initial team you are on is your role base. Please look at the bottom of your screen on the Role Reveal screen, or above your name in game to see what your actual role/team is.</p>

<details>
<summary><b><font color=gray>Can I install Town of Host: Enhanced on computers, phones, tablets, & consoles?</font></b></summary>
<p>You can only install mods on PC/Computer. You must have the Steam, Epic, Xbox App, or Itch versions of Among Us to download mods. If you have no PC/Computer, you donâ€™t need to worry as, even if you don't have/can't get the mod, you can still join Host-Only mods (such as TOHE, TOH, PL, etc) as long as you have Among Us on any device! You can find the lobbies of these mods to join and play as long as you are on the right game version.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b><font color=gray>What is Game Master/GM?</font></b></summary>
<p>The Game Master is an observer role.<br>
Their presence has no effect on the game, and all players know who the Game Master is. The Game Master role will be assigned to the host, who will automatically become a ghost at the start of the game.<br>
(Note: You can enable this in the Settings Gear. If you want to play normally, disable in again in the Settings Gear)</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b><font color=gray>How do I get the log file?</font></b></summary>
<p>You have three methods to get log files:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F1</kbd> in the game, then you can find the log file on your desktop, the file name starts with <code v-pre>TOHE...</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send the message &quot;/dump&quot; in the game, then you can find the log file on your desktop, the file name starts with <code v-pre>TOHE...</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please find your Among Us game directory, enter the <code v-pre>Among Us/BepInEx</code> folder, and then you will see a file called <code v-pre>LogOutput.log</code>, this is the log file.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b><font color=gray>How can I access Beta & Alpha Builds?</font></b></summary>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Anybody can get Beta Access by visiting <code v-pre>#tohe-beta</code> in TEN's Discord Server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Become a Contributor, Tester, or Sponsor (Insider+) for Alpha Access.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b><font color=gray>Can you use the Submerged mod with Town of Host: Enhanced?</font></b></summary>
<p>While this is technically possible, we don't recommend it as Submerged still requires all players to have it installed to play. If you do want to attempt this, we can say that the host would need Town of Host: Enhanced (TOHE) installed (as it's intended for only the host to install), as well as having Submerged installed. All of the people in your lobby could join normally but they would need the Submerged mod installed. (This applies to any custom Among Us map, Submerged is used in the example however, as it's one of the most popular)</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b><font color=gray>Why can't I post in #role-ideas in The Enhanced Network Discord?</font></b></summary>
<p>Role Ideas are currently locked to Sponsors, Nitro Boosters, &amp; Contributors. This is so that the Developers/Contributors of Town of Host: Enhanced can catch up on role ideas. The channel will open back up at a later date, but there's not a specific time.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b><font color=gray>How do I become Contributor or Translator?</font></b></summary>
<p>Keep in mind, both of these require you to add significant changes, it can't just be a &quot;one and done&quot; sort of deal. If you are an inactive Contributor/Translator, you may be removed from the team.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To earn Contributor, you'll need to help with coding Features, Roles, Game-modes, and so on for Town of Host: Enhanced. To do this, you will need a token. You can obtain one of these by creating a ticket in TEN's Discord Server and asking for an API Token. Moe will get back to you at some point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To earn Translator, you'll need to help with translating Town of Host: Enhanced into other languages supported by Among Us (See supported languages on the Resources Page). If you want to translate a language that Town of Host: Enhanced hasn't yet started, you may create a ticket applying for the position (of course, it will only be you unless other people apply for the same position) and wait for Ryuk or Moe to get back to you. If you want to translate Town of Host: Enhanced into another language but Among Us doesn't yet support it, you can do that in your own english.dat file and share it in #website-feedback when you are finished. (Info on english.dat on the Resources Page.)</p>
