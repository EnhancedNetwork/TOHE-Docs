When the kill Cooldown is over, the Quick Shooter can reset the Kill Cooldown by Shapeshifting, and will Store a Bullet. (When the storage is successful, a shield-like animation will appear to show that they successfully stored a Bullet.) <br>
After a Quick Shooter completes a kill, he can offset the Kill Cooldown until he runs out of bullets. At the beginning of each meeting, the Quick Shooter can only keep a certain number of bullets (Set by Host).

- Shapeshift cooldown
  - Set the Quick Shooter’s Shapeshift Cooldown
