<p>The Undertaker was the typical school nerd, well-informed about the workings of quantum physics. One day, he had had enough. The bullies who kept tormenting him were too much to bear.</p>
<p>He knew how to kill, alright, but in his heart, he didn‚Äôt want to be found out; after all, he had a reputation to maintain. He was well-versed in the art of killing, but in the end, there was only one way he wouldn‚Äôt be caught: if he used his brain. üß†</p>
<p>He devised a plan: whenever he used an ability, it would create a rift that teleported the dead corpses away‚Äîthanks to quantum physics. But after his revenge, he became a bit too comfortable with killing. He made it his hobby, using his intellect for evil.</p>
<p>He transformed into THE UNDERDOG, but he didn‚Äôt like that name, so he thought of himself as an underdog who took other people‚Äôs lives to become The Undertaker.</p>
<p>In the end, one thing was off: it took too much energy for him to maintain his methods. He froze in place for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Ultimately, he was caught by the Sheriff, the Reverie, and the Knight. But that story is for another time.</p>
