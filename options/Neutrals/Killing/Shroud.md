As the Shroud, you do not kill normally.<br>
Instead, use your kill button to shroud a player.<br>
Shrouded players kill others.<br>
If the shrouded player doesn't make a kill, they'll kill themself after a meeting.<br><br>
Shroud sees shrouded players with a 「◈」 mark next to their name.<br>
Shrouded players who did not make a kill will also have the 「◈」 mark in meetings, where they'll die if the Shroud is alive by the end of the meeting.
