<p>As the Possessor, you are able to possess players when others aren't in the Alert Range. Lead the possessed player as far as possible from other players that are in the Focus Range. Once the possession duration is up, the possessed player will be killed if others aren't in the Focus Range. If you run into another player in the Alert Range while possessing, the Possessor will immediately unpossess.</p>
