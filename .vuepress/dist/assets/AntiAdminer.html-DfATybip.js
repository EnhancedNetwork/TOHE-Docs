Everything! He had Perfect aim, Meticulous art of Striking and Oh so wonderful Technological skills but something was missing… Chapter 2 Free will? Or Fate Everyone in perimedes’ family was well a spy and they thought this was just fate and he would also just become a spy, But being a rebel and refusing to let others dictate his journey… But oh well… Chapter 3 Told you so “Shut up” said Peri to his brother as Mr.Sloth chose him to go up to Mira HQ as well…. A spy undercover due to his skills in evading attacks and technological skill but he wasn’t satisfied… Not at all… Chapter 4 Redemption Time Enraged with passion and a fire inside to prove himself the spy went on and improved his skills in… Killing.
