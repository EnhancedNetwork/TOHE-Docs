<p>Pestilence - Die.
&quot;AAAAH&quot; (This is repetitive I know)
The Plague bearer took the anti dote and... Ahh Finally I can be healthy.. As he took the antidote he was cured of the plague he transferred to others and the people that interacted with the infected people..</p>
<p>The Pestilence had weakened the crew who could only kill other weakened crewmates
The Pestilence was invulnerable to every threat from the beans except being ejected... And then the war of 1889 started and..
The pestilence started slashing and killing and Stabbing every crewmate in sight... And the sheriff tried to kill him but he put too much power to overpower the Pestilence and stumbled over and died</p>
<p>Win for the pestilence...
[ A curious Person who Had a plague and transferred it then killed it In a nutshell ]</p>

<p>They brought an Apocolypse.. And killed everyone</p>
<p>The horsemen of the Apocolypse</p>
