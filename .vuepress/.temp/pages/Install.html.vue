<p>Notice: You can follow the installation video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oyD75caFQ0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE<ExternalLinkIcon/></a> if you want visuals with steps. However, the below steps work just fine.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download the latest full Release of Town of Host: Enhanced in <code v-pre>#mod-release</code> or <a href="https://github.com/0xDrMoe/TownofHost-Enhanced/releases/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here<ExternalLinkIcon/></a>. You only need the main zip such as &quot;<code v-pre>TOHE.v1.0.0.zip</code>&quot;, not the source code files. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE <code v-pre>-MS</code> FILE, IT WILL NOT WORK!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the download is complete, unzip it into a new empty folder like on desktop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Locate your AmongUs install. For example, if you own the game on Steam, you can find this by right clicking on the game in your library, selecting &quot;Manage&quot;, and finally selecting &quot;Browse local files.&quot;<br>
<img src="@source/images/SteamGetFolder.png" alt="image"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select all of the files in your Among Us installation and copy them to the folder that now has the files from the TOHE release. The folder should now look something like this:<br>
<img src="@source/images/ResultFolder.png" alt="image"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the TOHE folder, run <code v-pre>Among Us.exe</code>. The first time running it may take some time while the mod sets up its files. If you see a black screen, just wait a couple minutes. Once it finishes loading, you should get a popup with TOHE news. If you do not see anything about TOHE, double check that your files are all in the same folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code v-pre>(Optional)</code> Right click your <code v-pre>Among Us.exe</code> and click '<code v-pre>Create shortcut</code>'. Move your new shortcut to wherever you can easily access it, such as your Desktop!</p>
</li>

<p>Once the download is complete, open the installer and click install. You can change the destination if you want, but that's not required. Once Mod Manager is installed, close the installer (delete it if you'd like) and open Mod Manager (There should be an icon on your desktop, if not then check around in AppData).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code v-pre>(Notice)</code> If you get a notification like this upon opening Mod Manager, re-install Among Us fully.<br>
<img src="@source/images/ModManagerFail.png" alt="image"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you open Mod Manager, swap your search category to <code v-pre>Active Mods</code>. Search the page for Town of Host: Enhanced. Click the download icon on the TOHE box, and wait for it to download. Once it downloads, head to your Mods Library and start TOHE.</p>
