<hr>
<p>The Arsonist can douse by clicking the kill button on the player and following them for a few seconds. When the dousing starts and it's successful, a shield animation will be displayed as a reminder (only visible to themselves). When the Arsonist has doused all surviving players, the Arsonist can vent to start the fire and win alone.</p>
<p>If the player name shows „Äå‚ñ≥„Äç, that means they are being doused;
if the player name shows „Äå‚ñ≤„Äç, it means they have been completely doused.
Depending on the setting, Arsonist may start the fire anytime. But if he failed to kill everyone, he loses.</p>
