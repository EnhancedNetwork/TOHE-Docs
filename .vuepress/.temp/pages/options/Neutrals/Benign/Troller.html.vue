<p>Neutral #24 danger level: Completely harmless but annoying</p>
<p>Now this is the troller he‚Äôs a mischievous little bean with only two goals in mind survive and make people Krazy, so yeah the troller was known to be just a regular guy working in a nuclear power plant and like him in the present he‚Äôs also a annoying prankster yeah nothing changed, so one day he was doing troll stuff making little inconveniences and stuff like making random noise and putting glue in the floor to slow people down but then</p>
<p>He thought of the funniest prank putting a safe room sign in a very radioactive room, yeah then someone suddenly went in the room and they unfortunately died after his co-workers found out they were furious and punished him by putting him in the room, you would have thought that this would also kill him well you thought wrong, because before this he ate some disgustingly large amount of foods like 1m sprinkles and a lot of chili cheese dogs and that for some reason rather thank killing him gave him the power of regeneration meaning if you killed him he will come back,  maybe not in the same game but he will</p>
<p>Then he just went out of the room like nothing happened, coworkers in shock then started to annoy them again, not a few days later some fancy dudes took him and now he‚Äôs lock up in the cell with some other neutrals, he usually just go in missions when there was no choice and they got desperate, all he needs to do is survive and cause chaos like his original job :yippe:, do think like mess up with sabotage, mess up everyone‚Äôs speed or just teleporting everyone in different places, he doesn‚Äôt care who wins he just need to complete his task and survive,
Hate him or Love him, he from the bottom of his heart cares for everyone, now give him some pizza ‚Äì sincerely not The TROLLER</p>
<p>The Solsticer
