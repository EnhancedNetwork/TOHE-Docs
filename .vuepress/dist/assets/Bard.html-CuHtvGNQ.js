I was in that once,” The Bomber recalled, grinning. “It tasted funny. You should give it a try; it’ll be fun!”</p><p>“Hmmm… they do say curiosity killed the cat,” Arro mused.

It’s literally you, but… more nerdy!” The Bomber exclaimed, barely containing his laughter.</p><p>“Let’s show it to the boss,” Arro suggested, intrigued by the potential.</p><p>An Unexpected Mission</p><p>The Mind, curious about this new development, decided to send The Arrogance and the newly acquired Bard on a mission. It started smoothly until a meeting was called, and an innocent bean was ejected.

Moreover, after each ejection, the Bard’s cooldown was halved.</p><p>“This is definitely something special,” The Arrogance concluded. Thus, he became known as The Bard—a unique force within the game.</p><blockquote><p>Submitted by: burgerman7286</p></blockquote>",20))])])}const y=l(c,[["render",g]]),w=JSON.parse('{"path":"/options/Impostors/Secondary/Bard.html","title":"Bard","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"lang":"en-US","title":"Bard","prev":"Arrogance","next":"Arrogance"},"headers":[],"git":{"updatedTime":1744340392000,"contributors":[{"name":"Pyro","username":"Pyro","email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","commits":5,"url":"https://github.com/Pyro"},{"name":"Moe","username":"Moe","email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","commits":2,"url":"https://github.com/Moe"},{"name":"NotPyro404","username":"NotPyro404","email":"141536178+NotPyro404@users.noreply.github.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/NotPyro404"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"38ab0e431f533cff9c37600954f3711e86981e69","time":1744340392000,"email":"141536178+NotPyro404@users.noreply.github.com","author":"Pyro","message":"1.0.0 (#110)"},{"hash":"c80c384b9150ba5b0e1e7d4cdb41b6146bbc3747","time":1743109625000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"Secondary folders + Mod.md OVERHAUL 10x better"},{"hash":"8136e77622d793028f3522612f3c2c435e5add71","time":1728767165000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"2nd lore batch (imp killing)"},{"hash":"7fc68e1230c9315e7f360c63aba8ea6b51537745","time":1727502289000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"Prepare Impostors for LORE EVENT"},{"hash":"b68b0b8db2d9a0add00403a3d13ff00947637072","time":1712986216000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"Fixing Commit"},{"hash":"aa062b340030314393f7082012f2eb0bc1a751ce","time":1697791596000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"editing things that needed editing"},{"hash":"59128e8bad5c8e914681667327a7b9c4eaacafb1","time":1697419067000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"fixes"},{"hash":"26b30d44c5cb808a938cba010a335e9807e1344d","time":1697273020000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"sidebars and coloring/bolding of roles"}]},"filePathRelative":"options/Impostors/Secondary/Bard.md"}');export{y as comp,w as data};
