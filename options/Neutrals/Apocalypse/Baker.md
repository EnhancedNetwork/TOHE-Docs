As the Baker, you can use your kill button on a player per round to give them Bread.<br>
Once a set amount of players are alive with bread, you become Famine.<br>
If the Bread gives additional effects setting is on, then you can vent to change the bread that you give out.<br>
<b>Bread Effects:</b><br>
<i>Reveal:</i> Reveals the target's role to the Baker (stays the whole game)<br>
<i>Roleblock:</i> Sets the target's kill cooldown to 999 (resets to normal after meeting)<br>
<i>Barrier:</i> Gives the target a barrier that is only known to the Baker (barrier is removed after meeting)
