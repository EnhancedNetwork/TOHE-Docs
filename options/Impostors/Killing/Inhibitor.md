Prologue:
Once, there were two impostors who were the best of friends: The Saboteur and The Inhibitor. They worked together for The Mastermind, playing tricks and executing plans, always ready to support one another. Their friendship was strong, but everything changed one fateful day.

Chapter 1: The Prank Backfires
One morning, as they drove to work, The Inhibitor decided to play a prank on The Saboteur by tampering with his car. However, the prank went awry, and they accidentally struck a mysterious figure in the road. Panic set in as they jumped out to assess the situation.

The Inhibitor: “Oh, I’m so sorry! The car was sabotaged!”
Mysterious Figure: “Both of you! You’ve caused enough trouble in this town. What should your punishment be?”

Terrified, they sped away, realizing the gravity of their mistake.

Chapter 2: A Strange Curse
After the incident, The Saboteur found himself unable to complete any kills. Frustration mounted as he failed repeatedly, and he wondered if the mysterious figure's words had cursed him.

The Saboteur: “This is the fifth time! Do you think what that strange guy said was true?”
The Inhibitor: “Maybe... it started after the accident.”

Desperate to regain his skills, The Saboteur vowed to find the source of his misfortune.

Chapter 3: Confrontation and Guilt
When he stumbled upon a newspaper article hinting at the incident, he confronted The Inhibitor.

The Saboteur: “Did you really sabotage my car?!”
The Inhibitor: “It was just supposed to be a little revenge!”
The Saboteur: “A LITTLE?! I can’t kill anymore because of you!”

The tension escalated into an argument, and in the heat of the moment, they parted ways, leaving their friendship in tatters.

Chapter 4: A Heavy Heart
The Inhibitor felt a deep sense of guilt for what had happened. Every time a sabotage occurred during missions, she was reminded of their broken bond. The weight of their conflict made it nearly impossible for her to act as an impostor.

Now, when sabotages occurred, The Inhibitor would hesitate, unable to strike while memories of their friendship haunted her. The Saboteur's curse lingered, a reminder that sometimes, the bonds we forge can become our greatest challenges.

Epilogue:
As time passed, both impostors learned that their actions had consequences, shaping not only their fates but also their friendship. Now, when sabotage was needed, it was a race against time—because stalling could stall The Inhibitor.
