Chapter 1: Darkness

The crewmates were in a state of panic. The lights had gone out, and a shadowy figure darted through the darkness, leaving chaos in its wake. Blood spattered the walls, and the sense of impending doom hung heavily in the air.

Chapter 2: Flashback

“Ah, what a great day!” thought the scientist, immersed in his research on nanoparticles. He envisioned a groundbreaking technology that would enhance agility and stealth. This invention was meant as a gift for the sheriff. With a stroke of genius, he created the Ninja Suit. This suit could mark a target and then render the wearer invisible for a brief moment. In an instant, the wearer could shift from one location to another—one moment in Electrical, the next in Admin.

Chapter 3: Back to Reality

Back in the present, the crewmates were on edge, struggling to navigate the pitch-black environment. One crewmate, frustrated by a mischievous fellow flicking the wrong switches, suddenly heard a chilling SLASH. Panic set in as two crewmates whispered urgently to each other.

“Where is he? Where is he?”
“Keep your head down; he’s aiming for the lights!”
“He’s using the darkness to conceal his approach!”

Another SLASH echoed through the air—three kills in mere seconds. The remaining crewmates realized they were in grave danger.

Chapter 4: Sabotage Resolved

“Finally!” exclaimed one crewmate as he fixed the sabotage, just in time to spot the shadowy figure nearby. With only three crewmates left, they were at a disadvantage. The agile Ninja was a master of evasion. Believing he was safe, they ejected an innocent crewmate, thinking they had eliminated the threat.

But the Ninja had been in control the entire time. Once a brilliant scientist, he had succumbed to the temptation of his own creation. “Why should I share this gift?” he thought. “It’s mine—only mine!”

Conclusion

In the end, technology can be both a healer and a harbinger of chaos. The Ninja, once a scientist driven by innovation, now embraced his darker side, proving that brilliance can lead to ruin.

The End
