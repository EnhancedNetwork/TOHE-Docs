As the Twister, you can use shape-shifting to randomly swap the position of all players. The swap happens twice, once when you start your shape shift and once when you return to your original appearance.<br>
The Twister itself will not swap places with anyone and players who are in vents cannot be teleported.

* Shapeshift Duration

  * <font color=red>OFF</font>: players can see who they swapped places with
