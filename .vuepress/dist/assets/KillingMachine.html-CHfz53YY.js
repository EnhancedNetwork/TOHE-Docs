But none of these stories represent the true inspiration behind the Killing Machine that sparked Dr. Moeâ€™s vision: a relentless terminator with a singular purposeâ€”to eliminate.</p><p>In the Lab</p><p>In a high-tech lab, Dr. Moe collaborated with Mr. Sloth on an ambitious project: a Killing Machine. Their plan was to equip it with an arsenal of weapons, rendering it unfit for stealthy maneuvers. To enhance its focus, they partially blinded it, ensuring it wouldnâ€™t hesitate when faced with its targets. They also removed any sabotaging devices. After years of tireless work, the project emerged as a successâ€”but the Killing Machine struggled in the world of deception.</p><p>Game 1: The First Encounter</p><p>The Killing Machine made its debut beneath the dropship on Polus, where it swiftly eliminated its first target. Fortunately, no one witnessed the act.</p><p>Round 2: An Open Office</p><p>In the next round, the Killing Machine struck in the office, dispatching a victim right in front of five witnesses. The chaos led to a swift emergency meeting. Despite its earlier success, it stumbled during one of its worst moments, ultimately leading to its ejection. One Impostor remained.</p><p>A Shift in Strategy</p><p>Despite the setback, the Killing Machine was not entirely ineffective. As more agile and strategic players emerged, such as the Arrogance, they adapted their tactics, keenly observing when crewmates were isolated. They demonstrated that while the role of the Killing Machine may seem disadvantageous, the effectiveness lies in the intelligence of the player wielding it.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In the end, no role is inherently useless; itâ€™s the strategy and intelligence of the player that determine success. The Killing Machineâ€™s potential remains, waiting for the right mind to harness its power.</p><p>The End</p><blockquote><p>Submitted by: champofchamps78</p></blockquote>",14))])])}const y=r(d,[["render",u]]),w=JSON.parse('{"path":"/options/Impostors/Killing/KillingMachine.html","title":"Killing Machine","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"lang":"en-US","title":"Killing Machine","prev":"Instigator","next":"Ludopath"},"headers":[],"git":{"updatedTime":1728767165000,"contributors":[{"name":"Moe","username":"Moe","email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","commits":2,"url":"https://github.com/Moe"},{"name":"Pyro0TV","username":"Pyro0TV","email":"141536178+Pyro0TV@users.noreply.github.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/Pyro0TV"},{"name":"Pyro","username":"Pyro","email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","commits":6,"url":"https://github.com/Pyro"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"8136e77622d793028f3522612f3c2c435e5add71","time":1728767165000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"2nd lore batch (imp killing)"},{"hash":"7fc68e1230c9315e7f360c63aba8ea6b51537745","time":1727502289000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"Prepare Impostors for LORE EVENT"},{"hash":"b68b0b8db2d9a0add00403a3d13ff00947637072","time":1712986216000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"Fixing Commit"},{"hash":"306a0e8118d1ff168a0a7783f087ab8e3d6123f8","time":1711465575000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"Impostors"},{"hash":"716875e01de3590016e3a8f5c1c20c55eda634df","time":1700487629000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"More Changes/Fixes!"},{"hash":"5503f4654ad09c72b887026c52b1c33c1ec56b45","time":1697184121000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"fixed some crediting"},{"hash":"dd8990e91e0ba57c4f28b3dd84a7173356b9af93","time":1697089321000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"a lot"},{"hash":"e177392ff37ed7122fce2d88d12883f940270aa3","time":1695251060000,"email":"141536178+Pyro0TV@users.noreply.github.com","author":"Pyro","message":"updating"},{"hash":"0eb4fd4e982e4a0f59181d864e68cb1e31069d01","time":1691109314000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"update"}]},"filePathRelative":"options/Impostors/Killing/KillingMachine.md"}');export{y as comp,w as data};
