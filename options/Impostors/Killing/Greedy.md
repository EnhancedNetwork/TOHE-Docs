Prologue

Legends tell of an impostor known for having two kill cooldowns that alternate, allowing him to strike quickly. However, his greatest flaw was his insatiable greed. Whether he was the richest being in the universe or buried under a mountain of debt, he always craved more.

A Fateful Bet

Cut to Ludopath, enthusiastically playing pancake blackjack on Discord.

Ludo: “I can’t stop winning! Bzzt, I can’t stop winning!”

Underdog: “Hey Ludo, wanna make a bet?”

Ludo: “Sure! What kind of bet do you have in mind?”

Underdog: “How about the one with Mind? I bet you can’t beat him!”

Ludo: “That was just a fluke!”

Underdog: “Sure. I heard there’s someone luckier than you at the casino. If you can beat him, I’ll give you cookies for a year!”

Ludo: “Luckier than me? Impossible! You’ve got a deal. Who is he?”

Underdog: “They say he takes out both even and odd numbers, each with different cooldowns.”

Meeting Greed

Greed: “Heard you’re the most fortunate one here.”

Ludo: “Of course I am! I want to make a bet.”

Greed: “A bet, you say? I’m listening.”

Ludo: “Let’s do rock-paper-scissors, best of three. If you win, you get everything I have. If I win, you come with me!”

Greed: “Interesting. But I heard you lost last time you played.”

They played, and Greed won easily.

Greed: “Easy as taking candy from a baby!”

Ludo: “Wait, double or nothing! I’ll throw in the deed to The Mastermind Company!”

Greed: “Deal!”

The Showdown

Ludo: “Rock!”

Greed: “Paper!”

Ludo: “Rock!”

Greed: “Paper!”

Ludo: “Rock!”

Greed: “Scissors!”

Ludo: “I won! YES, I WON!”

Greed: “Aww, dang it!”

They returned to HQ, presenting Greed to Underdog, who was in disbelief.

Now Underdog is broke from cookies. Please donate to him! And guess what? Greed is now working for Mind.

Final Note

You’ve just met The Greedy! The key to defeating him? Stick together, count the even and odd kills, and just hope he gets a little too greedy!
