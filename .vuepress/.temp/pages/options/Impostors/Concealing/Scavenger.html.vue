<p>The Scavenger had once been a regular crew member, peacefully completing tasks when disaster struck: a critical sabotage left the crew unable to respond in time. Unfortunately, the ship crashed. Fortunately, he survived, alongside a scientist and a noisemaker. With all the Impostors gone, he noticed a knife lying in the wreckage. Seizing the opportunity, he grabbed it and hid it away.</p>
<p>The scientist managed to contact MiraHQ, promising that help would arrive soon, but as time dragged on, their situation grew desperate. In a moment of panic, the Scavenger made a drastic choice and eliminated the noisemaker, who let out a surprised gasp before collapsing. When the scientist arrived at the scene, he was stunned‚Äîhe had never imagined a crew member could take such action.</p>
<p>Driven by desperation, the Scavenger felt a strange hunger take over. He realized he had crossed a line he never expected to. Checking the scientist's device, he saw that a rescue ship was finally on its way. But when the ship arrived on Polus for inspection, the Scavenger saw his chance to break free into the unknown, leaving everything behind.</p>
