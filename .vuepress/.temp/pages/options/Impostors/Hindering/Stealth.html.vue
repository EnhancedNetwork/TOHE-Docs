Chapter 3 Wait what Wherever the Superstar went he was recognized as an Impostor because of his super bright Light he emitted from his body while walking so he had to cover up but while killing well The cover fell off Chapter 4 AAH MY EYES Now the eyes of unsuspecting nearby Crewmates when he killed started to burn vigorously, screaming with pain the whole room was dazzled but after a bit it was all fine?! New ability? Like Smoke bombs? MAYBE!! Chapter 5 Dethroning Disperser Now again the Impostor games started and disperser vs Stealth while disperser baffled stealth by teleporting him Just by killing a person nearby every Impostor was blinded and stealth swooped in and killed EVERYONE Well...
