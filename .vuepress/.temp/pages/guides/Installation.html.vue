<ol>
<li>
<p>A Working PC or Laptop. (Among Us is on many platforms such as Mobile Devices, Consoles, &amp; PC. You can only install mods on PC/Computer. If you don't have a PC, it's alright because you can still join Host-Only mods as long as you have Among Us on any device!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among Us paid for &amp; installed on your computer. (Note: Pirated Versions of Among Us will <b>NOT</b> work for TOHE, nor do we condone pirated editions of the game.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any Browser such as Google, Opera, Firefox, and so on. (Any browser should work just fine!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A little bit of spare time. (This can take a bit if you are brand new, but don't worry about it!)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Make sure that you install the proper files during Installation. <code v-pre>TOHE.dll</code> is meant for updating if you've already installed the mod (More on that later), TOHE's Source Code will not work at all.</p>
