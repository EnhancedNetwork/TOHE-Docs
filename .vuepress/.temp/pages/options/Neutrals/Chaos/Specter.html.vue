<p>‚ÄúLife is amazing if you greet it with open arms‚Äù</p>
<p>She only have one missio</p>
<p>and she will do anything to fulfill it, they say when a ghost focus on a goal well enough they could come back to finished so they‚Äôre soul could rest in peace, well she was one of the first ones, they were just a regular crewmate, had a great job, had an amazing  life, a lot of friends and a loving husband, too bad she wouldn‚Äôt ever seen him again</p>
<p>She was an amazing crewmate and was promoted to be an engineer meaning she could use the vents for her advantage and it really did, because she was highly known to able to finished her task at a high speed, most people sometimes don‚Äôt like her for just finishing her task and doing semi stupid decisions so she could go back into doing it</p>
<p>But it was gonna be her 1000th streak so she pulled every trick in her book, all of the tips and shortcuts to finished it but because of this she missed some important evidence and information for the impostors like everyone the goes in electrical dies, she didn‚Äôt care she had 3 tasks there and will do anything to do it, then she came face to face with the impostor and while doing her task she got stabbed in the back, she was so close she can‚Äôt die now she must do the task, and she did before she died she completed it and with one more smile she finally died and rest in peace</p>
<p>The impostors won but while looking at the results of the mission, something was off it says impostors won but at the bottom it also says +Specter, know one knew who was the Specter but all they knew she apparently also won</p>
<p>Months later</p>
<p>Sci: Are you ready for this, we don‚Äôt really know if this would work</p>
<p>ALT: YEAH, LET ER RIP, or I could say let me rip
3, 2, 1</p>
<p>Spec: Wait what, what happened why is there a dead guy beside me
Sci: Greetings Specter don‚Äôt worry about him, we could used someone with your determination</p>
