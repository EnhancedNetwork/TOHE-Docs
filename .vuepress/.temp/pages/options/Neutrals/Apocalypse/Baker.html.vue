<summary><b><font color=gray>Unofficial Lore</font></b></summary>
<p>In the forgotten annals of time, the Baker was not always an agent of chaos. Legends speak of a humble artisan, a wandering spirit whose bread once brought hope and sustenance to those on the brink of despair. However, this pure-hearted soul was corrupted by the whispers of the Apocalypse - a malevolent force intent on unraveling the fabric of life. The Baker’s gift, once a symbol of life, became a tool of dread.</p>
<p>(1) The Gift of Bread</p>
<p>The Baker’s bread is no ordinary creation. Each loaf is imbued with a fragment of the Apocalypse’s will, turning sustenance into a means of control. By offering bread to others, the Baker sows the seeds of chaos, their recipients unknowingly marked by doom.</p>
<p>(2) Bread may nourish, but in the Baker’s hands, it carries sinister effects</p>
<p>Revelation: A mystical mark reveals the target's essence to the Baker, binding their soul in an unseen contract. Suppression: A cursed crust that drains the target's will, rendering them powerless for a time. Barrier: A deceptive gift of protection that only the Baker knows how to wield, a shield that vanishes after a pivotal moment. Only by balancing stealth and strategy can the Baker achieve their true purpose: the heralding of Famine ?</p>
<p>(3) The Path to Famine</p>
<p>The Baker is but a harbinger, a precursor to something far darker: Famine, one of the Four Riders of the Apocalypse. For every loaf handed out, for every soul ensnared by bread’s cursed touch, the Baker becomes closer to their transformation. When enough have succumbed, the Baker ascends into Famine - a harrowing figure of starvation and decay.</p>
<p>Will the Baker’s victims rise against them in time, or will the world crumble beneath the shadow of Famine? The answer lies in the hands of the crewmates—where every loaf is a choice, and every choice becomes closer to oblivion.</p>
