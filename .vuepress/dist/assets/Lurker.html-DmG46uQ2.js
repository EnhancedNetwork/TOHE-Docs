With an uncanny ability to leverage his surroundings, he transformed even the most overlooked assets‚Äîlike the vents‚Äîinto tools of his trade.</p><p>Chapter 1: Flashback</p><p>Back at HQ, where the Lurker made his home, paranoia was his constant companion. He felt suspicion creeping in from every angle, convinced that even his friends were plotting against him. As a small crewmate wandered nearby, the Lurker lurked just around the corner, conserving his energy and watching intently.</p><p>Chapter 2: Back to Reality</p><p>Now stationed in HQ, the Lurker embraced his role as an Impostor. Standing near the balcony vents, he pondered the advantages of his hideouts. ‚ÄúThe vents aren‚Äôt so bad,‚Äù he mused. ‚ÄúSpacious, quiet‚Ä¶ and a perfect spot to recharge before making my next move.‚Äù</p><p>Chapter 3: Venting Strategy</p><p>In and out of the vents he went, mastering the art of stealth. Despite the cramped space filled with CO‚ÇÇ, he had learned to dart in and out quickly. His efficiency allowed him to recover energy fast, reducing his cooldown time between strikes. It was one of his most brilliant plans yet.</p><p>Chapter 4: Death Follows</p><p>Wherever he roamed, death seemed to follow. Sipping tea in the comfort of the vent, the Lurker reveled in his cunning. Meanwhile, crewmates cowered in fear, anticipating the swift and silent demise that awaited them.</p><p>Chapter 5: Fear in the Air</p><p>The crewmates grew increasingly anxious, terrified to turn corners or traverse hallways, knowing the Lurker could be lurking just out of sight. With bodies piling up, the atmosphere grew heavier with dread.</p><p>Chapter 6: A Rainy Revelation</p><p>The Lurker&#39;s plan seemed flawless until the crewmates began to connect the dots. His frequent forays into the vents, where he stashed his supplies, raised suspicions. What had once been a clever strategy now drew unwanted attention.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Vents may have their uses, but they are hardly the ideal place for relaxation. A simple truth emerged: turning them into hideouts for secret meetings can lead to trouble. Sometimes, it‚Äôs better to keep your tea parties in the open!</p><blockquote><p>Submitted by: champofchamps78</p></blockquote>",17))])])}const w=h(d,[["render",g]]),k=JSON.parse('{"path":"/options/Impostors/Killing/Lurker.html","title":"Lurker","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"lang":"en-US","title":"Lurker","prev":"Ludopath","next":"Mercenary"},"headers":[],"git":{"updatedTime":1728767165000,"contributors":[{"name":"Moe","username":"Moe","email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","commits":5,"url":"https://github.com/Moe"},{"name":"lars-wu","username":"lars-wu","email":"129853907+lars-wu@users.noreply.github.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/lars-wu"},{"name":"Pyro","username":"Pyro","email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","commits":5,"url":"https://github.com/Pyro"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"8136e77622d793028f3522612f3c2c435e5add71","time":1728767165000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"2nd lore batch (imp killing)"},{"hash":"7fc68e1230c9315e7f360c63aba8ea6b51537745","time":1727502289000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"Prepare Impostors for LORE EVENT"},{"hash":"b68b0b8db2d9a0add00403a3d13ff00947637072","time":1712986216000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"Fixing Commit"},{"hash":"2426ac62a661645258e6ef08e13476b55e1fd892","time":1701264583000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"code spacing"},{"hash":"26b30d44c5cb808a938cba010a335e9807e1344d","time":1697273020000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"sidebars and coloring/bolding of roles"},{"hash":"4cc5756ae7ef36b34f062c53fa8393fddefc459e","time":1692162152000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"ImpostorSidebars"},{"hash":"edb5122a2c999484463439f630c3f9c83f307f65","time":1692073277000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"3.0.0 Dev 1 Build Changes"},{"hash":"a446d5319c8f2562731d64fa849640b3407cb3b6","time":1691990853000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"Adding Sidebars to Killing Impostors"},{"hash":"d51207d49a668d91b2393493855f5c4b69137216","time":1691513432000,"email":"129853907+lars-wu@users.noreply.github.com","author":"Papercut","message":"Update Lurker.md"},{"hash":"9248f765685c2882c6e452b3f1f06543b7a2aec1","time":1691287625000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"dev8.1"},{"hash":"0eb4fd4e982e4a0f59181d864e68cb1e31069d01","time":1691109314000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"update"}]},"filePathRelative":"options/Impostors/Killing/Lurker.md"}');export{w as comp,k as data};
