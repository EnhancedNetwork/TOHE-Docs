Every day, he looked up and wondered if he could ever be one of those fortunate Beans living in the Headquarters. He had heard rumors of Mr. Sloth and Mr. Moe, the main founders of Modded Among Us, discussing new roles.</p><p>The warlock knew quite a bit about manipulation and trickery. Usually, his show involved asking one person from the audience to hypnotize them into doing whatever he wanted.</p><p>Originally, his muggle parents had named him Wizard, but that was quite boastful, wasnâ€™t it?</p><p>Starting his show, he felt today would be quite a journey. He brought his grapple hook, wanting to make a memorable exit. But today would be quite the rollercoaster of emotions for him.</p><p>When the show started, he was enthusiastic, and everything went well until the last performance, where he mind-controlled a person, but it went HORRIBLY wrong. The hypnotized person killed another Bean.</p><p>Everyone was flabbergasted and ran after the warlock, but fortunately, he was able to escape and grapple onto the HQ. Lo and behold, he crashed into the venting system.</p><p>He tried to climb up, and when he did, he saw the horrible sight of an Impostor killing a crewmate. He literally used his tongue to poke the Impostor&#39;s eyes outâ€”ugh!</p><p>BUT THEN the Impostor turned, and they were eye to eye.</p><p>Oops, what to do now...</p><p>Suddenly, the Impostor said, &quot;I know what you did,&quot; and vented away. That was strange.</p><p>The warlock ventured into the laboratory, and what a surprise! Mr. Moe and Mr. Sloth were just talking about a new role when the warlock stumbled in and fell.</p><p>They both started laughing and asked him, &quot;Now, who might you be, young gentleman?&quot; He was too stunned to speak when Mr. Sloth said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry; we know weâ€™re the game masters.&quot;</p><p>They all went silent when Mr. Moe said, &quot;What about a deal? We donâ€™t report you, and you become our newest role?&quot; The warlock exclaimed, &quot;THAT WOULD BE A PLEASURE!&quot;</p><p>He just had to do one thing: kill many peopleâ€”too manyâ€”without being caught. Well, that was a twist. He thought about it and knew what he was going to do next: manipulate and kill all the crew.</p><p>The warlock became the newest role and went on to eliminate every single Bean in Mira.</p><p>Next destination: Polus, where he would meet the love of his life: the witch.</p><p>Quite a happy ending ðŸ™‚ even in the harsh universe of Among Us.</p><blockquote><p>Submitted by: champofchamps78</p></blockquote>",18))])])}const y=s(u,[["render",f]]),c=JSON.parse('{"path":"/options/Impostors/Concealing/Warlock.html","title":"Warlock","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"lang":"en-US","title":"Warlock","prev":"Vampire","next":"Wildling"},"headers":[],"git":{"updatedTime":1727507016000,"contributors":[{"name":"Moe","username":"Moe","email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","commits":4,"url":"https://github.com/Moe"},{"name":"Pyro","username":"Pyro","email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","commits":6,"url":"https://github.com/Pyro"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"521fb9b9085058f77f17290fe624df3d14e4d177","time":1727507016000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"First Lore Batch"},{"hash":"7fc68e1230c9315e7f360c63aba8ea6b51537745","time":1727502289000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"Prepare Impostors for LORE EVENT"},{"hash":"b68b0b8db2d9a0add00403a3d13ff00947637072","time":1712986216000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"Fixing Commit"},{"hash":"26b30d44c5cb808a938cba010a335e9807e1344d","time":1697273020000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"sidebars and coloring/bolding of roles"},{"hash":"1369587fab57d19e35171f0e2e01e729e1ff4d5f","time":1696561578000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"a lot of changes"},{"hash":"cd24ec0d7c9a2433ccf0020ffe85370dbafbb06b","time":1692919604000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"Wilding -&gt; Wildling Spelling Fixes"},{"hash":"4cc5756ae7ef36b34f062c53fa8393fddefc459e","time":1692162152000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"ImpostorSidebars"},{"hash":"8e2e2eeea36bf71f2b110335cfc343fa7571bd86","time":1691972491000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"ComcealingRedirectFix"},{"hash":"95b34c9e386e35dee47a349c3a9622aed600a52e","time":1691969729000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"Concealing Impostors Sidebars"},{"hash":"0eb4fd4e982e4a0f59181d864e68cb1e31069d01","time":1691109314000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"update"}]},"filePathRelative":"options/Impostors/Concealing/Warlock.md"}');export{y as comp,c as data};
