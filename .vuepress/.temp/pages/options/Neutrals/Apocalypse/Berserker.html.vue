<hr>
<p>As the Berserker, you level up with each kill. Upon reaching a certain level defined by the host, you unlock a new power.<br>
Scavenged kills make your kills disappear.<br>
Bombed kills make your kills explode. Be careful when killing, as this can kill your other Apocalypse members if they are near.<br>
After a certain level you become War.</p>

<p>&quot;fight little soldier fight little soldier fight&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I dont wanna fight in the army please&quot; he plead to them but off he was send to war at a very young age he was a little soldier and needed to be trained, so he was sent in a Basic combat training location, and he suffered there he was the fish out of water, the person that got bullied for his performance, and day after day after day when he rise to the moon and the sun and he doesn't know why it was getting worse and worse</p>
<p>He was taught weapons proficiency; But cant really handle it properly, basic drill orders; but he doesn't like listening to people, physical fitness; but he's really not healthy and physically fit , military discipline, and command structure; but he just gets confused when they started teaching it to him, TLDR he's really not cut out for this</p>
<p>One day while taking a break from the torture he tried to go in the forest to calm himself down and while being there he heard a rustle in the bushes he went too check it out and saw a mysterious man and he approached it obviously and he said he was there to help him</p>
<p>He said he could help him and with a new vitamin that he's testing but first he got to sign a contract that includes not blaming him when something bad happens, desperate he accepted it and after that day he started to perform better and better</p>
<p>War day the battle has started and the man that leaded them was no other than the &quot;amateur solider&quot; and when the kills started to happen one by one he started to grow in power he was like in a hot streak just kept killing and killing, not even the bodies were safe he destroyed them and not even 5 people at once can kill him he has an aoe attack, and just like that they won</p>
<p>But something happened, &quot;hey buddy we won maybe calm down a bit&quot;</p>
