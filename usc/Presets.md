You can save and load your favorite presets, or download ones shared by others.

If you are a new host, or a player looking for a more relaxed experience, try the <b>Starter Presets</b> below. They're also great for veterans needing a break. Once you're familiar with roles and perks, explore <b>Advanced Presets</b> or dive into <b>Expert Presets</b> for more complex setups. You can also check out <i>User Submitted Presets</i>, organized by difficulty.

For installation instructions, visit the [Guide to Presets](/guides/Presets.html).

Feel free to experiment with roles that catch your interest and adjust them to your liking.
