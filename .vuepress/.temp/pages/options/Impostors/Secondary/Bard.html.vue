<p>Here’s a refined version of your story that adheres to guidelines and enhances clarity:</p>
<p>A New Assignment</p>
<p>One day, after losing a bet to the Ludopath, The Arrogance and The Bomber found themselves assigned to clean the lab for a week. “And of course, the evil cloning machine is in there,” Arro grumbled.</p>
<p>“Honestly, this is your fault!” The Arrogance shot back.</p>
<p>“How was I supposed to know someone could eat that many pizzas in one bite?” The Bomber retorted, feigning innocence. “Well, excuse me for trying to get out of chores!”</p>
<p>Arro paused. “Isn’t that the evil cloning machine they were using?”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah! I was in that once,” The Bomber recalled, grinning. “It tasted funny. You should give it a try; it’ll be fun!”</p>
<p>“Hmmm… they do say curiosity killed the cat,” Arro mused. With a mix of excitement and hesitation, he stepped inside the machine.</p>
<p>A Surprising Outcome</p>
<p>Moments later, he emerged from the other side, transformed.</p>
<p>“Whoa! It’s literally you, but… more nerdy!” The Bomber exclaimed, barely containing his laughter.</p>
<p>“Let’s show it to the boss,” Arro suggested, intrigued by the potential.</p>
<p>An Unexpected Mission</p>
<p>The Mind, curious about this new development, decided to send The Arrogance and the newly acquired Bard on a mission. It started smoothly until a meeting was called, and an innocent bean was ejected. Instead of the usual role reveal, musical notes appeared on the screen: “♪ ♪ ♪”</p>
<p>The Arrogance observed this bizarre occurrence, realizing it kept happening.</p>
<p>“Hmm, interesting,” he thought.</p>
<p>Experiment No. 2</p>
<p>It became clear that the Bard could kill like any impostor, but something unique occurred when a player was ejected while the Bard was still alive: random musical notes would display instead of revealing roles. Moreover, after each ejection, the Bard’s cooldown was halved.</p>
<p>“This is definitely something special,” The Arrogance concluded. Thus, he became known as The Bard—a unique force within the game.</p>
