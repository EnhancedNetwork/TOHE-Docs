The Sun was shining, Birds singing and the Amnesiac humming a tune and swinging the knife around..
It was all wonderful until...</p>

The amnesiac saw a lonely bean running around desperately, He was so lost and afraid...
Interesting thought the amnesiac as he sneaked behind him and thought
&quot;Lets end his misery&quot;</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Last Words? No Last Essays!

He didn't stop Yapping and Yapping He vented out EVERYTHING to him..
And when He finally stopped talking and died?
The Amnesiac...</p>

Now looking through a corpse the Amnesiac pulled out the heart and listened carefully and pulled out neurons from the brain and surgically Put them into his own brain</p>
<p>Now he remembered that he was a crewmate and changed alliances...</p>
<p>iF tHe DeAd OnE wAs Of OtHeR aLlIaNcEs ThErE wOuLd Be VaRiEd ReSuLtS ðŸ¤“</p>
<p>And finally...
