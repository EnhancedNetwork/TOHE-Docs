<hr>
<p>As the Agitator, your premise is essentially Hot Potato.<br><br>
Use your kill button on a player to pass the bomb.<br>
This can only be done once per round.<br><br>
The player who receives the bomb will be notified when receiving said bomb, in which they need to pass it to another player by getting near a player.<br><br>
When a meeting is called, the player with the bomb dies.<br><br>
If trying to pass to Pestilence or a Veteran on alert, the bombed player dies instead.<br>
Optionally, the Agitator cannot receive the bomb.</p>
