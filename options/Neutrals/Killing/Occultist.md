As the Occultist, you can curse players or kill them.<br>
Cursing a player works the same as spelling as a Spellcaster.
* Switch Action via:
  * Kill
  * Vent
  * Double Click

  * <font color=green>ON</font>: Curses will have the same icon as spells
  * <font color=red>OFF</font>: Curse will have a different icon
