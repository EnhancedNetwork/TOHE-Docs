<p>As the Solsticer, you won't die, and you win by finishing all your tasks in a single round. After every meeting is finished, your tasks get reset, and you need to start all over again.<br>
Votes on the Solsticer will be directly cancelled.<br>
Kill attempts on the Solsticer will teleport it out of the map like Pelican until the meeting is finished.<br>
The killer's kill cooldown will be reset to 10 seconds.</p>
