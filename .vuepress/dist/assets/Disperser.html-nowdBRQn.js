The disperser was annoyed... Chapter 1 I cant even kill Due to his friendship with Mr. Sloth he was promoted from a crewmate to an Impostor but he faced many... Challenges Since everyone was in a group be it Neutral Apocalypse with their own team, Lovers, Followers or a cult People just wouldn't be solo and found off guard It was so frustrating and Maybe even Impossible to kill Unless Chapter 2 You won the battle, I win the War Now the Disperser went to his best friend the Mad scientist (Really, Him Again?) The Mad scientist was known to make ideas come to reality and this was going to be just another one of those cases The Disperser told about his plan that when he shapeshifts everyone would be randomly transported but how? Well there are many fruits found on fungus which contain Properties Of transportation The Mad scientist went on and brought those fruits now...
