Or ban players who are not logged in, have illegal nicknames, have been banned, and have Android systems. It may also be kicked out by EAC anti-cheat.

This situation is unavoidable, and all Host-only mods have this problem. If you still want to enter this lobby to play, you can only contact the host to reopen the lobby.</p><h2 id="your-connection-to-the-server-has-been-interrupted" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#your-connection-to-the-server-has-been-interrupted" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Your connection to the server has been interrupted</h2><p>If you find that other people can play normally, there are two possibilities:</p><ol><li>Among Us official servers are overloaded, this situation cannot be avoided.</li><li>It&#39;s time for you to replace the accelerator.

So for players who don&#39;t have the mod installed, you will see that you are an Impostor with no teammates. Please refer to the name on your head.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-host-only-mods" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-the-host-only-mods" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What are the Host-only mods</h2><p>H refers to Host, which is a mod that is compatible with the original version. It only needs to be installed by the host, and other players can play without installing the mod. In order to be compatible with the original version, the H-series mods have many functions and roles that cannot be realized. Even if they are realized, the way of realization is very strange. For example, the sheriff is shown as a Impostor, and the instructions of gambling monsters cannot be hidden.</p><h2 id="the-game-ends-inexplicably" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-game-ends-inexplicably" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The game ends inexplicably</h2><p>Game ends suddenly, If there are still imps alive and the victory conditions of the neutrals are not met.

When the bug occurs in the original TOH, the homeowner will not be able to see the start button, and other players will be loaded with an infinite black screen. In this case, everyone can only exit the game. In TOHE, in order to avoid this situation, it will automatically detect whether other players are stuck in loading, and if detected, the game will be automatically terminated to prevent everyone from being stuck. So it&#39;s a protection mechanism, just ignore it and keep playing.</p><h2 id="most-of-the-screen-is-black-but-the-sound-can-be-heard-and-there-is-a-setting-button" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#most-of-the-screen-is-black-but-the-sound-can-be-heard-and-there-is-a-setting-button" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Most of the screen is black, but the sound can be heard and there is a setting button</h2><p>A situation that may suddenly appear at the beginning or during the game. Most of the screen is black, only the top part of the screen is visible, the sound can be heard, and the setting button can be clicked, and the meeting will not be displayed.</p><p>This is caused by the failure of the client to assign roles, and it is also one of the unavoidable problems of the H-series mods.

If yes, please exit the game and check if there is an update button in the lower left corner of the main menu, if not, please restart the game and check if there is a update button again. If it still doesn&#39;t then it&#39;s not your problem, it&#39;s the host who needs an update.</p><h2 id="there-are-a-lot-of-duplicate-characters-in-the-game-without-setting" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#there-are-a-lot-of-duplicate-characters-in-the-game-without-setting" aria-hidden="true">#</a> There are a lot of duplicate characters in the game without setting</h2><p>Don&#39;t worry, we don&#39;t have this kind of bug, so please go to the settings and change the 15 max of this role back to 1 person.</p><h2 id="i-got-vanilla-roles" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#i-got-vanilla-roles" aria-hidden="true">#</a> I got vanilla roles</h2><p>Turn on the &quot;Disable vanilla roles&quot; option, and enable more roles.</p><h2 id="the-game-never-ends" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-game-never-ends" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The game never ends</h2><p>Please turn off &quot;No Game End&quot; in settings.</p>',46),r=[i];function s(h,l){return t(),a("div",null,r)}const c=e(n,[["render",s],["__file","FAQ.html.vue"]]);export{c as default};
