<p>Prologue Always, Always this happens I swear muttered the Time Thief as he went on with his pizza order... Chapter 1 Toppings? Always while buying pizza the person in front of the queue would keep on thinking about what kind of topping they would like rather than making up their damn mind!! Well This was so irritating and annoying for the time thief.... But not anymore Chapter 2 Employ and Deploy Employing the Mad scientist and started to engineer a whole mechanic Machine to Help people make up their mind quickly, Well not help Now going on he went and deployed the Make-up-your-mind-Inator all around the map and ensured that it would work... Chapter 3 Death for you Going on he explained how his machine worked, It worked by hacking into the Voting system Just like bard eh and Reducing the meeting time but this required Energy, This energy was taken from the screams of the crewmates... Chapter 4 Kill Kill and Kill The Time Thief went on and killed so many people that the machine reduced the meeting time to the minimum time, 10 seconds... Now the crewmates couldnt even realize what was going on as they randomly voted people out in the brief time period Chapter 5 I win In the end the Time thief got his revenge, The crewmates will finally make decisions faster, Pizza Here I come!! The End üòÑ</p>
