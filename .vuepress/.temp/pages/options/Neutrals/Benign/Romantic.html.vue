<p>The Romantic can pick their lover partner using their kill button (this can be done at any point of the game). Once they've picked their partner, they can use their kill button to give their partner a temporary shield which protects them from attacks. If their lover partner dies, the Romantic's role will change according to the following conditions:<br></p>
<ol>
<li>If their partner was an Impostor, the Romantic becomes the Refugee<br></li>
<li>If their partner was a Neutral Killer, then they become Ruthless Romantic.<br></li>
<li>If their partner was a Crewmate or a non-killing neutral, the Romantic becomes the Vengeful Romantic.<br><br></li>
</ol>
<p>The Romantic wins with the winning team if their partner wins.<br>
Note : If your role changes your win condition will be changed accordingly</p>

<ul>
<li>The Duel
&quot;Theodosia writes me a letter ev'ry day.
Theodosia, she's mine.
Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>The Romantic loved Theodosia, One of the people who understood him.
He talked to her daily and they worked as a team never leaving each other alone...</p>
<p>One day they were separated during a critical sabotage
And... The unimaginable happened...</p>
<p>There are moments that the words don't reach
There is suffering too terrible to name
The moments when you're in so deep
It feels easier to just swim down</p>
<p>As the Romantic sat down... Thinking what to do...
He thought about it for a while and saw the Maverick...
He knew the Maverick would do anything to survive and would kill anyone, Event the most harmless person...</p>
<p>Time to take revenge...</p>
<p>Dear Mister Maverick
I hope this finds you in due health
And in due favour..</p>
<p>You see... That was my friend that you decided to...</p>
<p>[Maverick]
Ki.....</p>
<p>Careful how you proceed, good man
Intemperate indeed, good man
Answer for the accusations I lay at your feet
Or prepare to bleed, good man
Then stand Mister
Weehawken, dawn
Guns, drawn</p>
<p>And so they met...</p>
<p>And they fought...</p>
<p>The Lover was a neutral..
The Taskinator..
So..
RUTHLESSNESS IS MERCY UPON OURSELVES..</p>
<p>And he shot the bullet</p>
<p>And The Maverick.. aims his pistol at the sky!
Wait!</p>
<p>I strike him right between his ribs
I walk towards him, but I am ushered away</p>
<p>I hear wailing in the streets
Death doesn't discriminate between the sinners and the saints
It takes, and it takes, and it takes</p>
<p>&quot;I survived, but I paid for it
Now I'm the villain in your history
I was too young and blind to see
I should've known, I should've known
The world was wide enough for both Maverick and me&quot;</p>
<p>As he sat down....
Regretting killing the Maverick....</p>
<p>And he sobbed and cried...</p>
<p>The end</p>
