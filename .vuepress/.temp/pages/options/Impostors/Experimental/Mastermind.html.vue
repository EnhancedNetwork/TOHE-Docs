<hr>
<p>As the Mastermind, you can use your kill button on a player once to manipulate them. This does nothing if the target doesn't have a kill button, but if the target has a kill button of any type, they'll be told after a delay that they were manipulated and they must kill someone in a limited time to survive. If the time limit expires or a meeting gets called before killing someone, they die.<br>
Double click on someone to kill them normally.</p>

<p>Mastermind was always bullied by others because he had an enormously large head. One day, he had enough; he knew he had to stand up for himself, so he became an Impostor on the ship.</p>
<p>He had only one goal: to influence and kill people. He knew that those who bullied him had a kill button, but they were far too afraid to use it. The best way for him to get revenge was to force them into a position where they had to kill.</p>
<p>Either they kill, or they die. üî™</p>
<p>But Mastermind knew one thing: this way of killing would win him the battle, not the war.</p>
