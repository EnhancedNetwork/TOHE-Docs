The lights had gone out, and a shadowy figure darted through the darkness, leaving chaos in its wake. Blood spattered the walls, and the sense of impending doom hung heavily in the air.</p><p>Chapter 2: Flashback</p><p>‚ÄúAh, what a great day!‚Äù thought the scientist, immersed in his research on nanoparticles. He envisioned a groundbreaking technology that would enhance agility and stealth. This invention was meant as a gift for the sheriff. With a stroke of genius, he created the Ninja Suit. This suit could mark a target and then render the wearer invisible for a brief moment. In an instant, the wearer could shift from one location to another‚Äîone moment in Electrical, the next in Admin.</p><p>Chapter 3: Back to Reality</p><p>Back in the present, the crewmates were on edge, struggling to navigate the pitch-black environment. One crewmate, frustrated by a mischievous fellow flicking the wrong switches, suddenly heard a chilling SLASH. Panic set in as two crewmates whispered urgently to each other.</p><p>‚ÄúWhere is he? Where is he?‚Äù ‚ÄúKeep your head down; he‚Äôs aiming for the lights!‚Äù ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs using the darkness to conceal his approach!‚Äù</p><p>Another SLASH echoed through the air‚Äîthree kills in mere seconds. The remaining crewmates realized they were in grave danger.</p><p>Chapter 4: Sabotage Resolved</p><p>‚ÄúFinally!‚Äù exclaimed one crewmate as he fixed the sabotage, just in time to spot the shadowy figure nearby. With only three crewmates left, they were at a disadvantage. The agile Ninja was a master of evasion. Believing he was safe, they ejected an innocent crewmate, thinking they had eliminated the threat.</p><p>But the Ninja had been in control the entire time. Once a brilliant scientist, he had succumbed to the temptation of his own creation. ‚ÄúWhy should I share this gift?‚Äù he thought. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mine‚Äîonly mine!‚Äù</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In the end, technology can be both a healer and a harbinger of chaos. The Ninja, once a scientist driven by innovation, now embraced his darker side, proving that brilliance can lead to ruin.</p><p>The End</p><blockquote><p>Submitted by: champofchamps78</p></blockquote>",15))])])}const y=r(g,[["render",p]]),w=JSON.parse('{"path":"/options/Impostors/Killing/Ninja.html","title":"Ninja","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"lang":"en-US","title":"Ninja","prev":"Mercenary","next":"QuickShooter"},"headers":[],"git":{"updatedTime":1735713408000,"contributors":[{"name":"Moe","username":"Moe","email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","commits":4,"url":"https://github.com/Moe"},{"name":"Pyro","username":"Pyro","email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","commits":8,"url":"https://github.com/Pyro"},{"name":"LezaiYa","username":"LezaiYa","email":"1792157206@qq.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/LezaiYa"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"147182ab315b3c80434688a25ff6a14a2f747d7c","time":1735713408000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"MEGA FORMATTING + probably something else I forgot"},{"hash":"8136e77622d793028f3522612f3c2c435e5add71","time":1728767165000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"2nd lore batch (imp killing)"},{"hash":"7fc68e1230c9315e7f360c63aba8ea6b51537745","time":1727502289000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"Prepare Impostors for LORE EVENT"},{"hash":"73d61a83b33325d195939a9d0d9956cb152fd3e2","time":1713123059000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"copy + pasting files, also dev/can changelogs"},{"hash":"b68b0b8db2d9a0add00403a3d13ff00947637072","time":1712986216000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"Fixing Commit"},{"hash":"501a06f0a40c2ae6ea294e4550a2007175c42fed","time":1704741737000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"re-adding files + small edits"},{"hash":"184f0903fa2e78f9a82092485e95d60dac9b489b","time":1701425079000,"email":"1792157206@qq.com","author":"LezaiYa","message":"Re-create the code"},{"hash":"26b30d44c5cb808a938cba010a335e9807e1344d","time":1697273020000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"sidebars and coloring/bolding of roles"},{"hash":"1369587fab57d19e35171f0e2e01e729e1ff4d5f","time":1696561578000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"a lot of changes"},{"hash":"4cc5756ae7ef36b34f062c53fa8393fddefc459e","time":1692162152000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"ImpostorSidebars"},{"hash":"edb5122a2c999484463439f630c3f9c83f307f65","time":1692073277000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"3.0.0 Dev 1 Build Changes"},{"hash":"a446d5319c8f2562731d64fa849640b3407cb3b6","time":1691990853000,"email":"btriche.sots@gmail.com","author":"Pyro","message":"Adding Sidebars to Killing Impostors"},{"hash":"0eb4fd4e982e4a0f59181d864e68cb1e31069d01","time":1691109314000,"email":"moebstergaming@hotmail.com","author":"Moe","message":"update"}]},"filePathRelative":"options/Impostors/Killing/Ninja.md"}');export{y as comp,w as data};
