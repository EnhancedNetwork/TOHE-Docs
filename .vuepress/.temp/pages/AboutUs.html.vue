<summary><b><font color=gray>About</font></b></summary>
<p>I'm a young developer who loves coding and gaming. I started coding when I was in High School, and I've been coding for 6 years. I'm currently learning several coding languages, but I speak English, French and Arabic verbally! I started playing Among Us when it released, and I've been playing it ever since. I stopped when the game died down after Airship, but I stumbled upon TOHE and I loved it. I decided to help out with the mod, and somehow I'm currently the Project Lead.</p>
<p>I specialize in HTML, CSS, SQL, and JavaScript, but I'm learning Python and C++. I graduated from College with a degree in Computer Science, and I'm currently working as a freelance web developer. My main goal is to become a full-stack developer, fousing on Cybersecurity. and I'm working towards that goal.</p>

<p>I help in role and feature coding, and also help in fixing bugs from time to time. I love listening to music and coding. I usually prefer to code in python whether it may be for competitive coding or a small program. I also love playing action-adventure games with a good story line. <s>I actually coded my first role with 0 knowledge of C# because someone who shall not be named couldn't code Vulture.</s> xV and Solarflare helped me a lot initially in helping me code features and roles.</p>

I really like Among Us mods and I have a lot of motivation to keep coding and playing. I enjoy coding challenges, like roles that are very complex and/or take a while to make. I like traffic lights more than anything else, especially those in the city I live in, since they also speak and have counters. I like everything timer related.</p>
