<p>Open the root directory of the mod and find the <code v-pre>..\Among Us\TOHE-DATA\Tags</code> folder to get started!</p>
<p>This folder holds 4 files (by default), 3 Folders (<code v-pre>MOD_TAGS</code> + <code v-pre>VIP_TAGS</code>, + <code v-pre>SPONSOR_TAGS</code>), &amp; a <code v-pre>Tag_Template.txt</code> file.<br>
You can disregard the 3 folders as those use a separate system of Tags, the new system utilizes the <code v-pre>Tag_Template.txt</code> file.<br></p>
<p>When you open the Tag Template, you'll see some lines to fill out, first Copy the Tag Template so things are easier (The mod will automatically generate a new one if you've lost it), then you can fill this out however you want to give a user a Custom Tag.<br>
You can leave most of it blank for a default tag (display) or edit the other lines with info for specific permissions. The file explains it clear enough, so use that.<br>
Once you've filled out the file, you can rename it to the friendcode of the player you want to have the Tag (Like friendcode#1234) and you're set.<br></p>
<p>If you'd like to sort your friend codes into custom folders, you may, and it will automatically be checked AS LONG AS it's in the Tags directory. (Note: Don't name the folders any of the following: <code v-pre>MOD_TAGS</code>, <code v-pre>VIP_TAGS</code>, &amp; <code v-pre>SPONSOR_TAGS</code>, as those use the old Tag System.)</p>
