When the Bard is alive, the ejection confirmation will display a sentence composed by the bard<br>
Whenever the Bard completes a creation, the Bard’s kill cooldown is permanently cut in half
* You must have “Disable Hidden Roles” toggled <font color=red>OFF</font> for this to have a chance to appear
