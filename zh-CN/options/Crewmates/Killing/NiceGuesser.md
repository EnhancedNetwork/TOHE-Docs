***

The Nice Guesser can guess the role of a certain player during the meeting.

If it is correct, the target dies, and if it is wrong, the Nice Guesser dies.

The guessing command is `/bt [player ID] [Role]`

You can see the ID of player’s next to their name, or by typing `/id`

(PS: You don’t need to worry about this if you have a TOHE Modded Client, as it includes a built-in Guesser GUI on Player Nameplates)
