Innersloth has decided to temporarily relax these measures, with plans to reinstate them on April 4th. This will give modders ample time to adapt to the changes in the anti-cheat strategy. We're actively working with the team to ensure a smooth transition. During this period, we'll be rolling out several test builds to assess the situation and prepare for the eventual reactivation of the anti-cheat measures. Please keep in mind that, due to the limitations of the game protocol, we cannot guarantee a fully stable experience on official servers once the Rate Limit anti-cheat measures are reinstated. Innersloth recommends that modders who cannot adapt to these changes consider moving to Modded Regions. These regions may offer a more consistent and stable experience than the official servers, making them an ideal alternative for many players. When playing on InnerSloth official servers, please be aware that the Rate Limit anti-cheat system may cause compatibility issues with most mods, leading to unexpected in-game problems that wouldn't occur on modded regions. There's also a small chance the anti-cheat system could flag you. If you experience any of these issues, feel free to submit a bug report through our Discord, and we'll do our best to resolve it. Once Innersloth reactivates its Rate Limit anti-cheat, Rate Limit Bypasses will be automatically enforced. Remember, this may cause unexpected issues on official servers, such as unhidden messages from guessers, delayed player name updates, packet loss resulting in missed updates, occasional black screens after meetings, and very slow loading times. If you continue to play with this option enabled, please be aware that the server may become unstable, and there is a slight chance of being flagged by the anti-cheat system. We will do our best to address these issues, but please understand that some may be beyond our control.",-1),F=l("b",null,"BUG FIX",-1),B=l("br",null,null,-1),w=l("b",null,"BUG FIX",-1),k=l("br",null,null,-1),E=l("b",null,"BUG FIX",-1),I=l("br",null,null,-1),N=l("b",null,"BUG FIX",-1),G=l("br",null,null,-1),x=l("b",null,"BUG FIX",-1),v=l("br",null,null,-1),X=l("b",null,"BUG FIX",-1),U=l("br",null,null,-1),M=l("b",null,"BUG FIX",-1),T=l("br",null,null,-1),C=l("b",null,"BUG FIX",-1),A=l("br",null,null,-1),R=l("b",null,"BUG FIX",-1),P=l("br",null,null,-1),S=l("b",null,"BUG FIX",-1),W=l("br",null,null,-1),O=l("b",null,"CHANGE",-1),L=l("br",null,null,-1),H=l("b",null,"CHANGE",-1),D=l("br",null,null,-1),V=l("p",null,"We've received a definitive update from the developers at Innersloth regarding the Rate Limit anti-cheat measures.
