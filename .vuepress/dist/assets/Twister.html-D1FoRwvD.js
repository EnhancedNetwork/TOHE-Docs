Well energy can be obtained by doing activities that release heat like.. Making of an egg during shapeshifting and... Going back from being shapeshifted But now the thing was... This teleported them twice which made it both difficult for the Twister and easy since it broke the bonds and groups of people but it was also difficult to find people during so many teleportations One drawback was that this was done with a sort of rain particle so people in vents were NOT influenced and this was a problem since they might eavesdrop on seeing The twister Shapeshift Huh... Maybe not as good of a technique thought the twister but that's the best he could do and well.... That's it why are you still reading? Oh you want Impostor games?
