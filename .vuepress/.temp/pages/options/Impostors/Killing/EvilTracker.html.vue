<p>Prologue</p>
<p>“CAPTAIN!” the Marine shouted, frantically testing new submarines to rescue stranded beans. “CAPTAIN! The ship’s sinking!” But the words were muffled by chaos.</p>
<p>Chapter 1: A Joyful Breakthrough</p>
<p>After days of hard work, Mr. Sloth was thrilled yet frustrated. He had been trying to develop an easy rescue service for beans whose ships had crashed on the island. “At last!” he exclaimed one day, joy radiating from him. He had finally created a boat that was easy to operate. But little did he know, trouble was on the horizon.</p>
<p>Chapter 2: A Sudden Crisis</p>
<p>At the Port of Mira HQ, our protagonist—soon to be an antagonist—sat peacefully in his chair as the ship drifted along. Suddenly, chaos erupted as bombs rained down. An impostor had seized the weapons in Mira HQ and targeted the ship. The attack was swift and devastating.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Struggling to Survive</p>
<p>As the ship sank, the Captain fought desperately to keep it afloat. Despite his efforts, the equipment short-circuited as water flooded in through the damaged areas. In a moment of desperation, he touched a loose wire and was shocked by a powerful jolt.</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Awakening in Anger</p>
<p>The Captain awoke in the hospital wing on Polus, where his co-pilot was crying and pleading for him to come back. When he finally regained consciousness, he felt an overwhelming surge of anger, stronger than anything he had ever experienced.</p>
<p>Chapter 5: A Sense of Betrayal</p>
<p>He realized that Mr. Sloth had foreseen the disaster but did nothing to prevent it. Betrayed, the Captain plotted his revenge against the crewmates. Each step of his plan became clearer as his fury grew.</p>
<p>Chapter 6: A New Power</p>
<p>The shock from the loose wires had granted the Captain newfound abilities. Harnessing the energy from the radar, he began tracking crewmate after crewmate. “Beware,” he thought to himself. “I know where you are.” With a chilling resolve, he set out to enact his revenge.</p>
