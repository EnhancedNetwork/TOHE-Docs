An endless cycle of tasks repeated by them to win</p>
<p>The pixie would tag them and bag them while the follower will Follow The tagged ones around and find dirt on them</p>
<p>And Man, The Man was Non-Stop
After the pixie retired the Follower was still YoungIsh And wanted to Pursue His dreams</p>
<p>The follower thus started following different teams different games and winning with them His only goal was to stay alive</p>
<p>And then after the games when the chaos ended and he wanted a break... he just wanted to live and since he was the student of the sheriff and the quick firer once he knew a new skill..</p>
<p>Making others misfire...</p>
<p>And so was the story of the follower who got tired of intruding that he became the Pursuer...
Just trying to live</p>
<p>But... The retired pixie warned him
&quot;Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom&quot;</p>
<p>And this Warning? Proved to be true soon...</p>
