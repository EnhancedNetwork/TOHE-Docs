<p>As the Deathpact, the targets of your shapeshifting are marked for a deathpact. If enough players are marked for a death pact, the marked players must meet within a defined period of time; if they fail to do so, they die. If a marked player dies before the death pact is completed, the pact is withdrawn.</p>

<p>Prologue:
&quot;This day we make a pact. Wherever we are. Whoever we become. We WILL meet again. Or die trying...&quot;</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Fight, Little Bean, Fight!
From a young age, the Little Bean learned that Impostor School was no ordinary place. It was a battleground where friendships were scarce, and enemies lurked around every corner. Each day, he faced his bullies head-on, determined to stand his ground. Fight or be defeated—those were the only choices.</p>
<p>Chapter 2: Surviving Somehow
Every day felt like a struggle for survival. The school was ruthless, and the Little Bean often found himself the target of cruel pranks. One day, he witnessed his fellow junior thrown into the lake, a reminder of the dangers that loomed. Recess was never safe, and he learned to stay alert.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Honor Among Impostors
Amidst the chaos, the Little Bean saw glimpses of honor. Crewmates made promises to each other, vowing to meet again no matter the odds. &quot;Swear to me you will meet again,&quot; one would say. &quot;Best friends forever,&quot; the other would reply. This bond inspired the Little Bean, planting a devious idea in his mind.</p>
<p>Chapter 4: The Transformation
After years of relentless training, the Little Bean finally became an Impostor. With newfound powers at his disposal, he was ready to put his plan into action. But first, he had to navigate the maze of HQ—he couldn’t afford to miss his chance.</p>
<p>Chapter 5: The Plan
The Little Bean decided to use the crewmates’ own promises against them. By shifting into their forms with his telekinetic abilities, he reminded them of their vows. Guilt weighed heavily on them, forcing them to confront their bonds—or risk the consequences of not fulfilling them.</p>
<p>Chapter 6: The Perfect Strategy
As the Little Bean executed his plan, the crewmates began to fall one by one. Each success only fueled his confidence, proving that his strategy was effective. With every crewmate that perished, he felt a sense of accomplishment—a jolly good plan indeed!</p>
