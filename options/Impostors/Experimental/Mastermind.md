As the Mastermind, you can use your kill button on a player once to manipulate them. This does nothing if the target doesn't have a kill button, but if the target has a kill button of any type, they'll be told after a delay that they were manipulated and they must kill someone in a limited time to survive. If the time limit expires or a meeting gets called before killing someone, they die.<br>
Double click on someone to kill them normally.
* Max
  * Set the Maximum amount of Masterminds that can be in a match
* Time limit to kill someone
  * Set the amount of time the Masterminds target has until they kill someone before they suicide
* Manipulation notification delay
  * Set the amount of time it will take for the Masterminds target to be notified that they were manipulated

Mastermind was always bullied by others because he had an enormously large head. One day, he had enough; he knew he had to stand up for himself, so he became an Impostor on the ship.

He had only one goal: to influence and kill people. He knew that those who bullied him had a kill button, but they were far too afraid to use it. The best way for him to get revenge was to force them into a position where they had to kill.

Either they kill, or they die. 🔪

But Mastermind knew one thing: this way of killing would win him the battle, not the war.
