<p>‚ÄúYar har fiddle Dee Dee, being a pirate is alright to be‚Äù</p>
<p>Are you ready kids cause this is a something that you haven‚Äôt seen before, typically pirates are portrayed as bearded man that sails the seven seas for treasure and most of them are except for this one, meet our protagonist let‚Äôs just call him Pirate, rather than sailing the ocean he‚Äôs sailing space, that‚Äôs right he‚Äôs a space pirate just like a real pirate but in space. He‚Äôs goal is to have a big spaceship to travel to different Galaxies to find the perfect crew to work with</p>
<p>And there it was a ship flying off it was named the Skeld it was the biggest ship he ever saw so now he must have it, he quickly aboard the ship just like any other crewmate there and tried to blend in, he knew that he can‚Äôt take the ship all in his own and he also thought no one would ever join him so he made a plan while exploring the ship analyzing every part of it he started to picked his first victim</p>
<p>BODY REPORTED</p>
<p>They went to the meeting but something was wrong the person that was chosen by the Pirate, their mind was blank they could hear everyone but it‚Äôs like less audible, then he heard a voice choose another 0 to 2, confused he just picked two but then nothing, he can‚Äôt hear anything can‚Äôt see anything he feels like nothing like someone just switched off their brain, it was the Pirate Fun Fact about him maybe being in space for a long time and being exposed to radiation may have effects on you, but for him it greatly empowered him giving him the power to sink into peoples mind and play a game with them say the same thing and your mind is gone don‚Äôt say anything and then your mind is also gone</p>
<p>He was feeding on them every right guess it powered him up and with the last duel he won, he was now unstoppable you can‚Äôt beat him all you could do is abandon ship because this ship is not yours to keep it‚Äôs not his, no other than</p>
<p>THE PIRATE</p>
