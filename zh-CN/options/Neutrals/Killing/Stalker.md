The Stalker can kill anyone, and every kill will immediately cause electricity sabotage (if electricity is already sabotaged, nothing will happen). Stalker cannot vent. If the <font color=red>Impostor</font> wins while the Stalker is alive or the <font color=#8cffff>Crewmate</font> wins by killing the <font color=red>Impostors</font> (according to the host's setting, the Stalker may also win when the <font color=#8cffff>Crewmate</font> wins by killing the Neutrals), then the Stalker win alone.
