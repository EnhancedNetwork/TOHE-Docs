It's planting seeds in a garden you never get to see I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me Can leave their fingerprints and rise up I'm running out of time, I'm running, and my time's up Wise up, eyes up I catch a glimpse of the other side The Pixie leads a ghost's chorus on the other side" He was going into shock and about to die but then he thought about the tranquility of not thinking about anything at all And as the bullet hit him he flew off into a doze wondering if this was the end...
