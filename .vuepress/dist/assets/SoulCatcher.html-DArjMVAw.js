Unfortunately, the target crew was with a friend (more than friends, Iâ€™d say), so he knew what he had to do.</p><p>He went on a rampage, using all his energy to kill the friend. In doing so, his vision decreased, and he could no longer perform any other actions. Thus, the Killing Machine was invented!
