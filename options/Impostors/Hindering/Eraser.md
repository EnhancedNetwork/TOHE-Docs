Prologue Now we all know pencils are made up of graphite and this would be... Interesting Chapter 1 Never use a Pencil Rumors of a bean who died using a pencil were spreading, Crew all around were horrified and now the paranoia of not using pencils started to rise, Campaigns like "Take the Cil out of Pencil" "Graphite is Smite" began spreading out Chapter 2 A brave bean A brave little bean thought about whether the rumor was actually real or not because if not this would prove the power of Media even in among us
It was true but it changed everything later
Chapter 3 Now what?! Now the Bean was facing severe allergic reactions so he thought about researching more Literally a Mad scientist He found about Graphite and its harms, Graphite could make you forget and when paired with wood proved to be very gravely dangerous Wait... Chapter 4 You're in! After going to Mr. Sloth with a role idea the Bean was promoted to an Impostor and with a great ability.. To make others forget about their role? :O This would seem to be amazing... Now how this worked is during meetings while casting the vote the eraser would shoot a dark with Graphite in it and when it would hit the Target the crewmates would forget about their role compeletely Chapter 5 You, You and You Picking out targets the eraser ran out of graphite oof... Now we got to kill thought the eraser as he went on a rampage while the evil guesser was sleeping Now the Eraser told about the erased roles and the evil guesser guessed them as crewmates and it seemed to be a very extremely easy win!! Graphite?! Yes. Yes Graphite! The End
I forgot to add this
The Eraser was named so because being named pencil isn’t cool :p so the opposite is eraser and sounded cooler
