## Vote Streaks
We will be introducing vote streaks soon, so stay tuned for that! Vote streaks will give you more rewards the more you vote in a row! You will have the opportunity to get more rewards, such as Store Coupons, Crate Keys, and more!

## Vote Parties
Vote parties are a way for you to get more rewards for voting! When the server reaches a certain amount of votes, a vote party will start! During a vote party, everyone who is online will get rewards! The more votes the server gets, the more rewards you will get! You can see the current vote party progress by looking at the vote party progress bar on the right side of your screen. You can also see the current vote party progress by running the `/voteparty` command.
