As his name suggests, he specializes in tracking down targets, acting as the assistant to The Butcher. Equipped with night vision goggles, camo gear, and heat-detecting technology, he’s prepared for any challenge. But he doesn’t just hunt anyone at random; The Butcher provides him with a specific list of crew members and neutrals to target.</p><p>Every successful hunt allows him to take a small bite of his catch, replenishing his cooldown. However, if he mistakenly kills someone not on the list and eats them, his cooldown actually increases—a risky game he plays.</p><p>One day, while delivering some meat to The Mastermind, a conversation unfolded.</p><p>The Mastermind: “Bounty Hunter, right?”</p><p>Bounty Hunter: “Yup.”</p><p>The Mastermind: “I’ve heard great things about your work.”</p><p>Bounty Hunter: “So?”</p><p>The Mastermind: “This organization could use someone like you for important missions. What do you think?”</p><p>Bounty Hunter: “No thanks.”</p><p>The Mastermind: “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Don’t dismiss it so quickly.”</p><p>Bounty Hunter: “I’ve made up my mind. I’m fine. But if you really need my help, just call. I might be there.”</p><p>With that, he left the conversation hanging.</p><p>Now, with each mission, he continues his relentless pursuit. You can’t run, and you can’t hide.
