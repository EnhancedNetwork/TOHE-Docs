<p>The Escapist was once a regular Impostor, but he was cornered by a Sheriff, a Knight, and a Reviver. There was no way he could escape when his partners came from behind and brutally killed them. The Escapist was so scared that he couldn‚Äôt bring himself to kill for a long time.</p>
<p>At long last, he made his way to MiraHQ and met with Dr. Imp, who suggested he use a teleport gun to mark a position for easy escapes. Since then, the Escapist has not been caught once, and the crew has no idea.</p>
