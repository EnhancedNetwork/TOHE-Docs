<p>The Harvester can use the shapeshift menu to pick two players. These players will have their add-ons swapped upon the next meeting. While the Harvester is alive, every player killed by a Coven member will have a configurable amount of their add-ons stolen by their killer. With the Necronomicon, the Harvester can kill. While the Harvester is alive, every player killed by a non-Coven member will have a configurable amount of their add-ons stolen and given to the Harvester.</p>
