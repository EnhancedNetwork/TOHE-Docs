<hr>
<p>Butcher kills (including passive kills) have multiple dead bodies on targets, making it impossible to accurately identify other dead body when reporting. Note: Due to the principle of implementation, the killed target has to repeatedly display the animation of being killed. This animation cannot be skipped and cannot participate in the meeting normally during this period. In addition, if the Butcher kills the Avenger, the Avenger will revenges everyone in anger.</p>

<p>The Butcher's Secret</p>
<p>If you’re feeling a bit hungry for some meat, why not stop by The Butcher Butchery? He has everything—beef, pork, chicken, and even some <i>special</i> cuts. He’s known for being a friendly butcher!</p>
<p>Crew: “GUYS, YOU’VE GOTTA BELIEVE ME! I SAW PEOPLE IN THERE!”</p>
<p>Impostor: “Really? The butcher would never do anything wrong!”</p>
<p>Neutral: “From what I’ve heard, he’s one of the most respected around.”</p>
<p>Crew: “I know, but I saw it! It looked suspicious!”</p>
<p>Neutral: “What if we sneak in? If there’s nothing unusual, we leave. But if there is, we’ll let the authorities know.”</p>
<p>Impostor: “Ah yes breaking in and entering, my favorite sport.”</p>
<p>The trio carefully snuck into the butcher’s storage area, and what they discovered was shocking.</p>
<p>Crew: “Are those... the missing people from the reports?”</p>
<p>Neutral: “I can’t believe it! You were right!”</p>
<p>Impostor: “We’ve got to get out of here!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the butcher appeared. “Well, well, well! I didn’t expect visitors! You shouldn’t have come here.”</p>
<p>He advanced toward them, and the impostor quickly hatched a plan. Sneaking behind the butcher, he managed to distract him.</p>
<p>Impostor: “RUN! I’LL KEEP HIM OCCUPIED!”</p>
<p>The crew darted out, escaping just in time. The Impostor was not so lucky. They tried to warn everyone about what they saw, but no one took them seriously. Every time the little crewmate passed the butchery, he felt the butcher's gaze on him.</p>
<p>Now imagine walking through Medbay and seeing something unsettling. Well, be careful—because THE BUTCHER might be closer than you think!</p>
