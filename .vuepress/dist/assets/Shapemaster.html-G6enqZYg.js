His interest was piqued, and he couldn‚Äôt help but ask them about their plan.</p><p>They mentioned that one person was missing and offered him the opportunity to join them.</p><p>And wouldn‚Äôt he? Yes, yes, he would. The tailor began to think of a new idea.</p><p>What if he made costumes that looked like the other crew members? These costumes would be hella fun and easy to use.</p><p>He could easily frame many people‚Äîand in the end, he could win and sabotage the crew.</p><p>The plan was successful, and the Impostors were the last ones standing.</p><p>But then the plan went horribly wrong. There was nothing in the job offer that stated ‚ÄúGuaranteed Death,‚Äù even in victory. Oh man, what could he do now?</p><p>The ship was crashing, and the other Impostors just closed their eyes and accepted their fate. What a gruesome death.</p><p>But the tailor wouldn‚Äôt give up so easily. Oh no. When they were about to crash, the tailor surrounded himself with protection and survived! Whoo!</p><p>He took a dead scientist&#39;s tablet and waited for the ship to crash.</p><p>When the ship did crash, he was the lone survivor. He took the dead bodies out and started drinking their blood. It was his only source of nutrition, and soon he became addicted.
