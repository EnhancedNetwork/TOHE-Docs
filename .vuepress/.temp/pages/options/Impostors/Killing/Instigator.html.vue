<p>Prologue</p>
<p>The Instigator was a charismatic character, always feeling destined to be an impostor. He had a knack for understanding emotions, and he patiently awaited his moment.</p>
<p>Two Years Later</p>
<p>The Instigator was done waiting. Today was the best day of his life—he had finally become an impostor! He possessed a unique talent: the ability to instill fear, anger, and guilt in others.</p>
<p>Game 1: The Beginning of Chaos</p>
<p>The Instigator was on a roll, having taken down three crewmates in quick succession. He craved more chaos.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the game took a turn. BODY REPORTED
Three Dead Bodies Found
“I saw him kill—self!”
“Instant report, no bait message!”
“He’s lying!”</p>
<p>Everyone piled on the accusations against the reporter, who hadn’t even had a chance to defend himself. The reporter was actually a marshal who still had tasks to complete.</p>
<p>With two impostors remaining, the Instigator seized the opportunity. He approached one of those who had voted against him.</p>
<p>“He was innocent! You’ve ruined his chance! You’re a monster for doing this,” he said, dripping with feigned concern. “You can’t let this go. We can’t have someone like you in our midst!”</p>
<p>Gaslighting 101</p>
<p>His manipulative skills were effective; the crewmate began to crumble under the weight of guilt and doubt. In a moment of despair, they took drastic action against themselves.</p>
<p>With his cunning instigation, the Instigator remained hidden in the shadows, his identity safe. He reveled in the success of his tactics, knowing he had outsmarted them all.</p>
<p>“This much waiting was worth it,” he murmured, ready for his next games at Mira HQ.</p>
