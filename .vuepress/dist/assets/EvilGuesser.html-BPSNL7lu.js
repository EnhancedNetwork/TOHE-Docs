His eyes landed on a headline: “Hiring Detectives and Sleuths.” This could change everything for him.</p><p>Chapter 2: Back to HQ</p><p>“Ah, HQ. Brings back memories,” Sherlock thought as he entered the familiar space for his first game. While completing tasks, he stumbled upon a lifeless body. He examined it closely for clues and noticed distinct handprints. This discovery could lead him to the truth.</p><p>Chapter 3: The Accusation</p><p>Sherlock rushed to the lobby to share his findings. “I know who the killer is: John is Hangman.” Overcome with guilt, John felt he had no way out and took drastic action. “Well, that’s that,” Sherlock said, feeling the weight of his words.</p><p>Chapter 4: Another Target</p><p>During the next meeting, Sherlock made another bold claim. “I think Joe is the captain, based on his hands.” Unfortunately, this led to another innocent being ejected. “That’s another good person gone,” he thought, regret flooding in.</p><p>Chapter 5: A Descent into Darkness</p><p>“What have I done?” Sherlock whispered, looking at the metaphorical stains on his hands.
