<p>The plague bearer was a curious person who would even go to the extent he would experiment on his own body and it went.. Wrong..</p>
<p>The plague bearer made such a virus that only he had its cure and could even transfer by touch.. and interaction
And that made the person weak..
They couldn't kill the strong uninfected people..</p>
<p>And he went on and started interacting with people
But this went far better than he thought.. He realised that if the infected people touched/interacted with unifected too they would be infected...</p>
<p>Wow..
Curiosity got the best of everyone..
Always be curious</p>
<p>Back to story..</p>
<p>&quot;AAAHH&quot; He screamed in pain as after infecting everyone he drank the anti dote... It was painful recovering from the virus..
Very Painful..</p>
<p>But now he was invulnerable to infected crewmates...
Except for ejection and Space..</p>
<p>And.. In the war of 1888 this was...
The Turning wave..</p>
<p>&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAH&quot; He screamed in agony...
To be continued
Stay tuned in</p>
