<p>Description: Very Anti Social, Introverted, Seen as a Grinch by other neutrals, pretty sure going more and more insane after each day, Have little wings which she can use to hover, Would beat you up if you say sheâ€™s a fairy</p>
<p>Status: In her cell, gave her dolls so she can shut up and she seems quiet now</p>
<p>FILE THE PIXIE</p>
<p>Do you believe in magical creatures, Unicorns fairies well what about Pixies they were said to be A small, mischievous fairy-like creature from British folklore. Pixies are said to have pointed ears and hats, and are often depicted in green. They are said to enjoy leading people astray, the worst thing mentioned here is that theyâ€™re British</p>
<p>But something you may not know about them is they enjoy negative energy mostly they enjoy misfortune on others because they feast on it, thatâ€™s their energy source and when they found something that can produce this much of misfortune of course they will take advantage of it, Well this is where our protagonist came into place they travelled to distant land to find ways of this disguised as one of them</p>
<p>They interviewed a lot of people asking what would be the most misfortunate situation they could be in and 80% answered is getting voted out and executed, you see there has been an increased of impostors in some of the jobs they had have and they said that their punishments is literally the worst thing that can happen on someone</p>
<p>Now she had a sneaky little plan she applied in a job inside the Mira HQ where they said some impostors may occur in some days itâ€™s just a boring there were still some misfortune here and there but it wasnâ€™t really strong but when there are impostors now she formed a plan, first she would pick a target like tagging them in some sort and now when there is a meeting she has to get em out most of the times if not voted out nothing would happen to her but when the odds are not in her favor and she really need the energy if they are not voted out sheâ€™ll unfortunately die</p>
<p>But that didnâ€™t happen to her it was a successful day and she was stuffed too bad she got arrested by the NPMD</p>
