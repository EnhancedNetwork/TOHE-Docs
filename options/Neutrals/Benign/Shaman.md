As Shaman you can use your kill button to select voodoo doll once every round. All the interactions with you using kill button will be deflected to the voodoo doll and the voodoo doll will destroy.<br><br>
Since Witch uses magic too, the effect of the voodoo doll will be nullified (voodoo doll won't be destroyed though) and will take place on Shaman itself.<br><br>
If you survive till the end, you win with the winning team.
