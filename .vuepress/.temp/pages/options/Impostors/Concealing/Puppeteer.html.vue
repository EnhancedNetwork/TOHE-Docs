<p>The Puppeteer had always excelled at crafting puppets; it was a passion that brought her immense joy. Yet, as a child, her peculiar interest subjected her to relentless teasing and ridicule. Frustrated by the constant mockery, she decided to take matters into her own hands.</p>
<p>Her plan was deceptively simple: she would turn everyone around her into her puppets. Whenever she passed someone, she would swiftly attach invisible strings, compelling them to act according to her whimsâ€”completely unaware of their manipulation.</p>
<p>And even if they did start to suspect something was amiss, well, all puppets eventually break after too much use, donâ€™t they? Such a pity, isnâ€™t it?</p>
