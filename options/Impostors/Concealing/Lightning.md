The Lightning cannot do regular kills. After the Lightning uses their kill button on the target, the target will vaporize into a quantum ghost after a set time, and everyone can see the 「■」 next to the name of the quantum ghost as a reminder. If there is non-spherical lightning and a player who is not a quantum ghost touches the quantum ghost, the quantum ghost will be quantized immediately and die. If the quantum ghost survives until a meeting, they will die after the meeting ends. During this time, any active interaction (kill button) with the quantum ghost has no effect. According to the host's settings, killing the Lightning may cause the killer to vaporize into a quantum ghost.

Lightning was previously the scientist for the crew, but he was bullied by the Sheriff and the Captain about how utterly useless his role was. One day, he had enough. He went to the dark side, knowing there was no return.

The tryouts for the Head Impostor team were happening when he joined, but he needed one thing: a whole ton of kills.

Driven by the urge to prove himself and become the superior Impostor, he knew he had to get the killer in a very short time. What better way to do so than with science?

He started dousing people with a bit of lightning, which could make others kill the target. This way, he was never caught; instead, innocent crew members were implicated, and in the end, he became the Monarch of the Impostors.

But there was one thing: he would never win a one-on-one against a neutral killer. Why? Because he could never kill himself—normally, he was far too scared of guns and knives. In the end, he died to a glitch and was dethroned.
