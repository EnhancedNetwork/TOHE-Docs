As the Addict, you have a suicide timer. When it expires you kill yourself.<br>
The timer is indicated by the vent cooldown. When the vent cooldown is at 0 seconds, you still have a short time to vent.<br>
If you don't make it you die, if you make it the suicide timer is reset.<br>
Also, after you are ventilated, no one can interact with you for a defined period of time.<br>
After this period is over, you are immobilized for another defined period of time and cannot report any bodies.
