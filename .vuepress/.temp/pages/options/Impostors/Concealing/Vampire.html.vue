<p>&quot;Ahh, where am I?&quot; mumbled the Vampire, confused and disoriented.</p>
<p>-- Flashback --</p>
<p>Once, he was the captain of a ship bound for MiraHQ for their monthly check-up. Everything was smooth sailing until suddenly‚Äî</p>
<p>&quot;Please take cover!&quot; the ship's motherboard blared.</p>
<p>That was bad news.</p>
<p>Then the ship crashed.</p>
<p>-- Flashback Over--</p>
<p>While the rest of the crew succumbed to hallucinations from their injuries, they began singing in a delirious state:</p>
<p>&quot;Some island, the first one we found,
It‚Äôs bursting with cows just roaming around,
Begging us to eat, so much meat,
And hunger is so heavy.&quot;</p>
<p>But where were the cows? The crew had lost their grip on reality, imagining each other as delectable feasts. Panic set in as their hunger intensified.</p>
<p>The captain, however, had a few tricks up his sleeve. Desperate, he found a knife and made a difficult choice, turning on his crew in a frenzy of survival.</p>
<p>But help was still three days away, and clean water was scarce. What he did have was a source of nourishment‚Äîblood.</p>
<p>Days passed, and when the rescue ship finally arrived, it found not a crew but a lone vampire. He understood one thing: he was no longer a captain; he was now the antagonist of his own story.</p>
<p>-- Next Destination: Polus --</p>
<p>&quot;How fortunate,&quot; thought the Vampire, a wicked smile creeping across his face. No one would notice if he took a bite, would they?</p>
<p>On his way to the lab for the check-up, he decided to indulge his hunger. As the doctors disappeared one by one, he mused, ‚ÄúWho will perform my check-up now? No one!‚Äù</p>
<p>With each passing day, he grew bolder, savoring his newfound freedom. Out of the shadows, he awaited the next shipment of crew members, eager for more mischief.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy not enjoy the wait?‚Äù he thought, planning his next move.</p>
