<p>The soul collector was just a normal bean until he started playing with ritual stones which could &quot;Supposedly&quot; Summon Hades from the underworld... but instead came aroma... Terrible Aroma if I am to say so As soon as the Soul Collector took in the wind he died... For 1 second his heart stopped His brain stopped Him blood became Ice... He Actually died and came back to life... Crazy stuff.. Then Hades sent up a quill with a note &quot;Thee has't awaken'd me, i am making a dealeth though beest greatful&quot; And The Soul collector wondered... Why tf is he speaking in Shakespeare... Then he saw a translate button to English &quot;You have awaken me, I am making a deal though... Be grateful&quot; The deal went like... &quot;Now You predict deaths for me... If you are right I send you a soul.. When you get a number of souls You become me... Death... For some time... I posess you Even if you are wrong and the person u predicted to die Doesn't die I'll passively send you souls... Deal? (Yes/Yes) Tick the option please &quot;Wow&quot; Thought the Soul collector as he picked &quot;Yes&quot; of course.. And now started his reign... You? Oh damn he didnt +1 Soul You? Yippee! He died +2 Souls Wait.. A dog? As he ran and ran and into a pole and fell down a pothole... But that's for another time.. But Hades did not do Him wrong.. Truly a great deal
