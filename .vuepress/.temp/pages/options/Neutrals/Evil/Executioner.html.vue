<p>&quot;Another beautiful Morning to chop off some heads eh chap?&quot; Declared the executioner to his fellow comrades as he picked up his scythe.
And then his pale faced, Green eyed friend came funning through the door with a knife stuck in his back
The executioner screamed &quot;NOO Who did this Agamemnon do you know?&quot;
&quot;A- Aeg- Aegisthus&quot;
&quot;Don't you dare leave me here Just stay awake.&quot;
But to no use, Agamemnon stopped breathing..</p>
<p>The whole day the Executioner was bawling and he refused to talk to anyone.
He had one goal in his mind though. Revenge.</p>
<p>As the dark dusty dawn shed light on the poorly lit room of the Executioner, A fire was lit in his eyes. He would stop at nothing to get back at Aegisthus.
The game has just gone afoot.</p>
<p>As the days went by the Executioner kept tip-toeing around Aegisthus' room trying to find some incriminating evidence. And it was a fortnight later that he was informed of the secret plan of Aegisthus to dethrone Ulysseus.</p>
<p>Now that he knew he could get the blonde, Blue eyed brilliant ruler of Ithaca behind his back? He would be unstoppable</p>
<p>Now the main plan comes to life.
Get everyone to believe The Executioners' story</p>
<p>And so he went. Exaggerating all the events and getting people to sympathise with him.
It was truly a great day to be him.</p>
<p>And then Aegisthus was executed by the hands of the executioner... Poetic truly</p>
<p>The executioner wins by getting revenge!!
&quot;All of this took so much work that I might just collapse&quot;</p>
<p>And the executioner became unconscious</p>
