Lovers are a combination of two players. The Lovers wins when only the Lovers is left. When one of the Lovers wins, the other also wins together. Lovers can see the 「♡」 mark next to each other's name. If one of the Lovers dies, the other will die in love (may not die in love according to the host's settings). When one of the Lovers is exiled in the meeting, the other will die and become a dead body that cannot be reported.
