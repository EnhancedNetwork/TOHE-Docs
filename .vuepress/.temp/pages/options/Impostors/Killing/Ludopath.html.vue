<p>Prologue:
Once a regular impostor, The Ludopath had a penchant for gambling that set her apart. With an uncanny streak of luck, she couldn’t resist placing bets wherever she went. It was all fun and games—until one day, her luck ran out.</p>
<p>Chapter 1: The Lost Bet
While placing a bet on a thrilling race, The Ludopath found herself on the losing side.
“What? No fair! You cheated!” she protested, her voice rising in disbelief.
“Cheaters don’t win, and I won,” replied the mysterious figure with a smirk. “Now, about your prize—why not speak to that person over there?”</p>
<p>Chapter 2: The Encounter
Reluctantly, she approached the cloaked figure.
“Hello, milady. I hear you’re quite upset about your loss,” he said, his tone smooth.
“A little, yes,” she admitted, her frustration simmering.
“Look closely,” he continued, revealing a video of the other gambler cheating.
“I knew it! I’m going to take him out!” she declared, her anger flaring.
“Wait,” he interjected. “I’ve heard you’re lucky. What if I offered you a deal? I’ll give you a randomized kill cooldown—down to one second. In return, I’ll ask for a favor in the future.”
“Sure, let’s do it!” she replied, excitement bubbling over.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: The Killing Spree
With her new ability, The Ludopath struck quickly. She killed again and again, reveling in her newfound power. Each successful kill reset her cooldown to just one second, and she kept going until she finally hit a cooldown of thirty seconds. Exhausted, she decided to take a breather.</p>
<p>Chapter 4: A New Gamble
You could often find her in her favorite casino, thriving in the excitement. But then, The Mastermind approached her with a proposition: a rock-paper-scissors bet. “If I win, you join me; if you win, you get all my cookies.”
Intrigued, she accepted the challenge, confident in her luck. However, The Mastermind, with his cunning mind, emerged victorious. True to his word, he welcomed her to his side, leaving her both shocked and intrigued.</p>
<p>Epilogue:
Now, while wandering Polus, you might hear her enthusiastic cry: “LET’S GO GAMBLING!” You face a choice: run away or take the gamble, for The Ludopath has embraced her fate—and she’s ready to play.</p>
