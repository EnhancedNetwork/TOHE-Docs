<hr>
<p>The killing method of the Hangman during the Shapeshifting is Strangling. Strangling ignores any status of the target. Such as the shield of a Medic, the skills of a Bodyguard or Superstar. The Strangled player will not leave a dead body, nor will it trigger any of its skills. For example, Veteran kills back, Luckey stays alive, etc. The Seer will not be alerted.</p>

<p>Prologue:
Hangman was known for his strength and dedication to fitness. Every day, he would hit the gym, pushing himself to new limits. But his true fascination lay in the study of the human body.</p>
<p>Chapter 1: A Vulnerable Discovery
One day, while studying in the science lab, Hangman came across a detailed chart of the human anatomy. He examined it closely, noting every detail until he fixated on one particular part: the neck. The neck, he realized, was the most vulnerable area of the human body, one that even the strongest defenses couldn‚Äôt fully protect.</p>
<p>Chapter 2: The Call of Mira HQ
During a routine monthly check-up at Mira HQ, alarms blared, signaling the presence of impostors. ‚ÄúThere are three impostors among us!‚Äù the announcement echoed through the halls. After several meetings, two impostors were ejected, leaving behind the strongest one‚ÄîHangman.</p>
<p>Chapter 3: The Disguise
Aware of his identity, Hangman decided to take advantage of the situation. He shapeshifted into the familiar form of the Marshall, who had yet to complete his tasks. The crowd gathered around, captivated by the superhero figure, but their awe quickly turned to fear.</p>
<p>Chapter 4: The Perfect Strike
In an instant, Hangman revealed his true self. He quickly subdued the Marshall, bringing him to the ground. The medic rushed to intervene, but Hangman was ready. With a swift motion, he took down the medic as well, solidifying his control over the situation.</p>
<p>Chapter 5: The Final Confrontation
In a climactic showdown against the Glitch, Hangman prepared for battle. As the Glitch attacked, Hangman calmly remarked, ‚ÄúYou should have gone for the neck.‚Äù With that, he executed his final move, overpowering the Glitch and securing his victory.</p>
<p>Epilogue:
The Hangman, known for his clever wordplay and love of language, became a legend. The game ‚ÄúHangman‚Äù was named in his honor, a nod to his unique ability to twist words just as skillfully as he dominated the battlefield.</p>
