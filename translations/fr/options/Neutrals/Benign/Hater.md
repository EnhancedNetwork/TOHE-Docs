As the Hater, you have no kill cooldown. However, you can only kill Lovers, and other recruiting roles/recruited add-ons, depending on the settings. Killing anyone else will make you suicide. You win at the end of the game with the winning team if none of the killable roles are alive. You will not be Lovers.
