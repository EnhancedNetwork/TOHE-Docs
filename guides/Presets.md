Presets are different saves of your settings. You can save your favorite settings as presets and load them later. You can also download presets shared by others. 

For some User Submitted Presets, visit the [Presets](usc/Presets.html) Page.

## <font color=#f0b6d5>How do you use someone else's Preset?</font>

### <font color=#ebd326>Step 1: Download + Rename Preset File</font>

If you want to use a preset that you've downloaded, make sure the file is renamed to `Options.json` before using it, if it isn't already. (If you do not have `File name extensions` marked on the `View` Tab, you only need to rename it to `Options`.)

### <font color=#ebd326>Step 2: Put Options.json in SaveData folder</font>

You have to put the file in the following directory: `...\Among Us\TOHE-DATA\SaveData` for it to work. (If you cannot locate `TOHE-DATA\SaveData`, try enabling `Hidden items` on the `View` Tab!)

### <font color=#ebd326>Step 3: Select Preset in TOHE</font>

Make sure you have the Preset selected in your System Settings, and play!

#### You have successfully downloaded and set-up a Preset!

## <font color=#f0b6d5>How do you share your own Preset?</font>

### <font color=#ebd326>Step 1: Locate your SaveData folder</font>

You can find this folder at the following directory: `...\Among Us\TOHE-DATA\SaveData`. (If you cannot locate `TOHE-DATA\SaveData`, try enabling `Hidden items` on the `View` Tab!)

### <font color=#ebd326>Step 2: Copy Options.json</font>

Copy the `Options.json` file from the `SaveData` folder, and paste it somewhere that you'll remember it, like the desktop.

### <font color=#ebd326>Step 3: Rename Options.json</font>

Rename your `Options.json` to whatever you want. John made a chaotic preset, he could name it `JohnsChaosPreset.json`, because it is <i>his</i> Preset, & it tells people how it's <i>chaotic</i>. 

### <font color=#ebd326>Step 4: Share your Preset!</font>

There are a few ways to do this, they are the following:

1. Send the File Directly: Simply send the preset file to your friends so they can easily use it.

2. Submit for Public Sharing To have your preset featured, create a post in the `#website-feedback` channel of our Discord. Your preset will have a chance to be added to the User Submitted Presets page!

#### You have successfully copied and shared a Preset!

### Now that you are familiar with Presets, you should learn how you can customize your lobbies, to make them stand out!
