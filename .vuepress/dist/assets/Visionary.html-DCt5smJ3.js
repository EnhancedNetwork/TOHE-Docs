Damn it" said the visionary as he ran into a wall Chapter 1 The... Accident The Visionary was doing tasks and minding his own business when- A rogue Impostor came out and STABBED the visionary in his eye... "Ah... How am I alive" Although blinded the visionary now knew that he had a new purose in life... A holy purpose due to which Even gods protected him Chapter 2 I feel bad now Zeus watching from his tower knew the visionary was a fun guy and he used to watch him all the time, He loved the visionary's Jokes and well... Gods Repay themselves.. Guilty with using the visionary for his own entertainment Zeus went on and shielded him EVERYWHERE except- The eys Chapter 3 Here Kid Take this Zeus was RAGING around his castle replaying the visionary's accident in his mind while pacing around...
