<p>As the Solsticer, you won't die, and you win by finishing all your tasks in a single round. After every meeting is finished, your tasks get reset, and you need to start all over again.<br>
Votes on the Solsticer will be directly cancelled.<br>
Kill attempts on the Solsticer will teleport it out of the map like Pelican until the meeting is finished.<br>
The killer's kill cooldown will be reset to 10 seconds.</p>

<p>Are your serious?
Well the terrorist former Specter was again revived since he technically won
So Mr sloths team revived him
Now he knew what he had to doâ€¦
Loose.
But how?
Well there was a new role released that relied upon tasks.
The solsticer.
Now his main aim is to do tasks in a certain round and win
But if he sees dead bodies his number of tasks Increase because he wants to remember the dead crew as a cherished memory
And if a meeting is called
He forgets his tasks because he has poor memoryâ€¦</p>
<p>So he needs to do a certain amount of tasks together in a round
But the solsticer in this game just stayed stillâ€¦
And the impostors canâ€™t kill solsticer so they just ignored him</p>
<p>As the last round approached people were vent camping so the solsticer speedran 9 tasks..
And won</p>
<p>Dang it.
His competitive nature got the best of him</p>
<p>The End</p>
