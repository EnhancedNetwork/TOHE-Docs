<p>Now that you’ve installed Town of Host: Enhanced, it's time to set up your experience, so let's do that!<br>
Don’t worry—this guide will walk you through every step, ensuring a smooth setup so you can jump straight into the action.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-set-your-game-settings" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-1-set-your-game-settings"><span><font color=#f0b6d5><font color=#ed543d>Step 1:</font> Set your Game Settings</font></span></a></h3>
<p>These are the Vanilla Among Us settings, which can be customized if you wish. If you’re new to Town of Host: Enhanced (TOHE), it’s recommended to leave these settings as-is for a default TOHE gameplay experience. You can tweak things like player speed, vision, and task difficulty to personalize your game.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-set-your-system-settings" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-2-set-your-system-settings"><span><font color=#f0b6d5><font color=#ed543d>Step 2:</font> Set your System Settings</font></span></a></h3>
<p>Here you can adjust System Settings to your preference. Most players leave these as the default settings until they’re more familiar with hosting games. These settings can affect aspects like how the mod behaves, performance, and certain special interactions during gameplay.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-select-your-gamemode" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-3-select-your-gamemode"><span><font color=#f0b6d5><font color=#ed543d>Step 3:</font> Select your Gamemode</font></span></a></h3>
<p>TOHE offers several gamemodes, but in this guide, we’ll be covering the Standard TOHE gamemode. This mode is inspired by Town of Salem, a popular game that TOHE is based on. Other gamemodes may be explored later as needed, but for now, select Standard to stay aligned with the most common experience.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-set-your-mod-settings" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-4-set-your-mod-settings"><span><font color=#f0b6d5><font color=#ed543d>Step 4:</font> Set your Mod Settings</font></span></a></h3>
<p>With your gamemode selected, it's time to configure Mod Settings. These settings let you customize specifics like:<br></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Guesser Mode: A mode where players can guess other players' roles.<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Map Selection: Choose how the maps are selected or even disable certain ones.<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devices/Tasks: You can enable or disable different tasks or modify the types of devices used in-game.<br></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Take your time with these settings, as they can drastically alter the gameplay experience. Once you're satisfied with your choices, move on to the next step.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-select-roles" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-5-select-roles"><span><font color=#f0b6d5><font color=#ed543d>Step 5:</font> Select Roles</font></span></a></h3>
<p>Now it’s time to choose your Roles! Each faction offers unique roles that define the gameplay:<br></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Impostor Faction: Includes roles for the Impostor team.<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crewmate Faction: Includes roles for the Crewmate team.<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neutral Faction: Roles that don’t belong to either team, with their own set of goals.<br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coven Faction: A third main team with its own unique objectives.<br></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Start with simpler roles that you’re familiar with, and then you can enable more complex roles as you get the hang of the game. If you're feeling adventurous, you can enable all roles, but be aware that this might be overwhelming for beginners.</p>
<h3 id="step-6-select-add-ons" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-6-select-add-ons"><span><font color=#f0b6d5><font color=#ed543d>Step 6:</font> Select Add-Ons</font></span></a></h3>
<p>Add-Ons are additional modifiers that layer on top of roles and can add unique effects to the game. Some are exclusive to certain factions (like Impostors), while others are available to everyone. Browse through the available Add-Ons to find ones that you may like!<br></p>
<p>If you’re new, start with simpler Add-Ons (like Bait, Autopsy, etc) before diving into more complex ones.<br></p>
<p>Experiment with adding them after you’ve gotten familiar with the roles, or try them out together for a more dynamic experience.</p>
<h3 id="step-7-finalize-settings" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-7-finalize-settings"><span><font color=#f0b6d5><font color=#ed543d>Step 7:</font> Finalize Settings</font></span></a></h3>
<p>You’re almost ready to play! Before you start your game, take a moment to finalize all of your settings!<br>
Maybe a role has a kill cooldown that's too long for the pace of your lobby, or a map is enabled that doesn't fit the vibe you're going for.<br>
Don’t worry if things aren’t perfect right away—you can always tweak settings later after you’ve had a few games to get familiar with them!</p>
