<p>The Miner had been working with the crewmates his whole life, exploring multiple planets and being introduced to their own spaceship, The Skeld—a huge airship—and even a Mushroom Wonderland known as The Fungle. However, the crewmates decided they no longer needed the Miner and planned to get rid of him, covering it up in the process.</p>
<p>Overhearing this, the Miner made the desperate decision to contact someone he vowed never to speak to: the Godfather. He begged for employment, selling his soul to the Godfather and sealing his fate.</p>
<p>It is said to this day that if you see an extra vent, your fate has been sealed too. So, you can sing your feeble thoughts and prayers, but they will do nothing to save you.</p>
