<hr>
<p>The Coven Leader can use their kill button on a fellow Coven member to retrain them into a random Coven role that isn’t currently in the game. During the next meeting, that Coven member will be notified that the Coven Leader wishes to retrain them. They can vote themselves to accept the retrain, or vote otherwise to deny it. Denying the retrain does not take away an ability usage.<br><b>With the Necronomicon, you cannot retrain, and can only kill other players.</b></p>
