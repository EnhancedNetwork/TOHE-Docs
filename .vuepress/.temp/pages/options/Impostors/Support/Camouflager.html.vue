Great experiments today class said Mr. Sloth who was teaching Chemistry to The aspiring crewmates and one of them would learn a lot from him.. Being a nerdy and Loving science he went to the school lab and started taking one on one personal classes from Mr. Sloth and having the time of his life. Chapter 2 Deadly art Going around and mixing random elements together was a very difficult and dangerous art and even had caused 2 fatalities in just Mr. Sloth‚Äôs school but the Little protagonist knew how to do all that pretty well so.. Easy for him‚Ä¶ Now looking at the atomic structures of atoms he wondered about a camouflaging gas which would transform the appearance of everyone‚Ä¶ Chapter 3 Poof And, To no one‚Äôs Surprise‚Ä¶ He was a 100% right‚Ä¶ the exact elements in the exact order he mixed gave the exact solution he predicted‚Ä¶ So skilful.. Now was the good part‚Ä¶ Using this for his hobby, Killing‚Ä¶ As he was an Impostor when he found this out he could easily use his findings‚Ä¶ Chapter 4 On our way to Fungle Now on their way to Fungle the Camouflager had an idea‚Ä¶ he could start killing on the map‚Ä¶ but he would be quite surprised‚Ä¶ He found so many rogue plants containing spaces for‚Ä¶ The gas he made wait‚Ä¶ What if he filled them with the gas.. And he did‚Ä¶ This made the Mira Mixup Sabotage and The Flower traps‚Ä¶ But the gasses mixed with the fluids inside the plants body and‚Ä¶ had some other effects Chapter 5 Camouflage Finally, The Camouflager went on and used his ability and started wiping off all the crewmates who had no idea what kind of witchcraft was going on‚Ä¶ It was crazy how fast crew were dropping And When a bean saw the camouflager kill... They just blamed the other bean.. And the Instigator took them Both out Good.. Great Game The Abrupt end‚Ä¶ For now</p>
