<ul>
<li>OBJECTION!
The lawyer was always arguing with authority not giving a damn what they thought, and when he was stopped he would just start throwing around big words which confused the officer and ultimately the officer let him free..
The lawyer found  a great way to earn money...
He was the first Lawyer... Let us call him... A. Ham
Now A. Ham had a competetor A. Burr who was an Executioner who needed to earn money by getting people Voted by the jury</li>
</ul>
<p>Now this was an ongoing battle which has not ended even YET...
Lawyer VS Executioner...</p>
<p>But one thing for certain if the target dies due to &quot;Circumstances&quot;
The lawyer's main goal is to be voted out and jester around the crewmates.. Stealing the win</p>
<p>Other wise... he just needed an Opportunity to win with the crewmates.. this was different for other lawyers...</p>
<p>But A. Ham? He was an Opportunist...</p>
<p>More to come 😛
THE END!
Oppo.. My love, take your time
I'll see you on the other side
Raise a glass to freedom.</p>
<p>And... He was shot between his ribs...
Opportunist by his side...</p>
<p>Will the tell your story?</p>
