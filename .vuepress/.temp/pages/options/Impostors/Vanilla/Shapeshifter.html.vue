<p>‚ÄúDUCK!‚Äù
Yea great way to start a story, I know
I was sitting in a pub when suddenly
‚ÄúFLYING CHAIR‚Äù
Yea.. Exactly that
I was hit in the head by a flying chair.. Great
I‚Äôm used to all this at this point but why should I be? I did nothing wrong except become the first Impostor and change all of amongus history Duh
But what if.. I could make a portable shell? Or More likely an Egg!
Hmm!!
And so I did.. After years of Manufacturing I finally created my master piece a portable egg which could form around me when I pressed a button but wait!
What if‚Ä¶ I could wear a uniform to look alike some other bean.. Like disguising.. Or..
Shapeshifting‚Ä¶
Yea Awesome! So I did.. Finally something to go back to killing for and Kill I did..!
And after a few kills.. Yea Time to go spectate being Game Master again This is boring but some other can take my button
And become the.. Shapeshifter!
Yea I know Cool right!
The end in any case!</p>
