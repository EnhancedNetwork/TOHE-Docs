(Or for some roles, such as Crewpostor, you are an Impostor but your base is Engineer so that you can do Tasks to kill.) So for players who don&#39;t have the mod installed, you will see that you are an Impostor with no teammates. The initial team you are on is your role base. Please look at the bottom of your screen on the Role Reveal screen, or above your name in game to see what your actual role/team is.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-host-only-mods" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-the-host-only-mods" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What are the Host-Only mods</h2><p>Host-Only mods are mods that are compatible with vanilla clients, meaning it only needs to be installed by the host and other players can still play without installing the mod.</p><h2 id="the-game-ends-inexplicably" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-game-ends-inexplicably" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The game ends inexplicably</h2><p>The game will end suddenly if there are an equal amount of Impostors alive to Non-Killing players (and the victory condition of a Neutral isn&#39;t met), the victory conditions of a Neutral is met, or the Crew is done all of their tasks.

The reason this occurs is because, there is a bug with Host-Only mods that fails to assign roles. When the bug occurs in the original Town of Host, the host will not be able to see the start button, and other players will be loaded with an infinite black screen. In this case, everyone can only exit the game. In Town of Host: Enhanced, in order to avoid this situation, it will automatically detect whether other players are stuck in loading, and if detected, the game will be automatically terminated to prevent everyone from being stuck.</p><h2 id="most-of-the-screen-is-black-but-i-can-interact-with-the-gui-and-the-sound-can-still-be-heard" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#most-of-the-screen-is-black-but-i-can-interact-with-the-gui-and-the-sound-can-still-be-heard" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Most of the screen is black, but I can interact with the GUI and the sound can still be heard</h2><p>This is caused by the failure of the client to assign roles, and it is also one of the unavoidable problems of Host-Only mods.
